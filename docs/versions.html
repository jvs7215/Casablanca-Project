      <h1>Three versions of the ending</h1>
      <p>This explores how the ending for the play, Everbody Comes To Rick's compares to two
         different drafts of the ending for the movie, Casablanca. We display these versions side by side in three containers. Mainly the three scripts
         are distinctly different, but in the rare occasions that the two
         Casablanca movie scripts are the same, they are shown to span together across the
         right-hand side of the screen. </p>
