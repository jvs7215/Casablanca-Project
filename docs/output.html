               hopefully, or desperately, toward the freedom of the Americas. Lisbon became the
               great embarkation point. But not everybody could get to Lisbon directly, and so,
               a tortuous, roundabout refugee trail sprang up. Paris to Marseilles, across the
               Mediterranean to Oran, then by train, or auto, or foot, across the rim of Africa
               to Casablanca in French Morocco. Here, the fortunate ones, through money, or
               influence, or luck, might obtain exit visas and scurry to Lisbon, and from
               Lisbon to the New World. But the others wait in Casablanca -- and wait -- and

            very young and attractive refugee couple from Bulgaria, watch as the civilian
            passes. They've been thrust by circumstances from a simple country life into an
            unfamiliar and hectic world. A shot RINGS out, and the man falls to the ground.
            Above him, painted on the wall, is a large poster of Marshal Petain, which reads:
            "Je tiens mes promesses, meme celles des autres." The policeman frantically searches
            the body, but only finds Free French literature.

            Carl laughs. The overseer walks up to a table with a paper in his hand. Then we see
            a drink and a man's hand, but nothing more. The overseer places a check on the
            table. The hand picks up the check and writes on it, in pencil, "Okay-Rick." The
            overseer takes the check. We now see RICK, sitting at a table alone playing
            solitaire chess. Rick is an American of indeterminate age. There is no expression
            on
            his face, complete deadpan. There is a commotion at the door as people attempt to
            come into the gambling room. He nods approval to Abdul. Then a GERMAN appears in the
            doorway. Abdul looks to Rick who glances back toward the open door and nods "no".
            Abdul starts to close the door on the man. 
            
            <span class="speaker abd">ABDUL</span>

             The man tries to push his way through the door as Rick walks up. 
            
            <span class="speaker rick">RICK</span>

            <span class="diag"> I've been in every gambling room between Honolulu and Berlin and if you think

             At this moment UGARTE, a small, thin man with a nervous air, tries to squeeze
            through the doorway blocked by the German. If he were an American, Ugarte would look
            like a tout. He gets through and passes Rick.

            up.

            <span class="diag"> This is outrageous. I shall report it to the Angriff!</span>
            
             The German storms off, tossing the pieces of his card into the air behind him.
            Rick meets Ugarte on his way back to his table.

            A couple comes in the front door. They are VICTOR LASZLO, the Czech resistance
            leader, and a very pretty young woman wearing a simple white gown, MISS ILSA LUND.
            She is so beautiful, in fact, that people turn to stare. The HEADWAITER comes up to
            them. 
            
            <span class="speaker hea">HEADWAITER</span>

             As the headwaiter takes them to a table they pass by the piano, and the woman
            looks at Sam. Sam, with a conscious effort, keeps his eyes on the keyboard as they
            go past. He appears to know this woman. After she has gone by Sam steals a look in
            her direction. BERGER, a slight, middle-aged man, observes the couple from a
            distance. The headwaiter seats Ilsa. Laszlo takes the chair opposite and surveys the
            room. Strasser and Renault look up at them from their table.

             Renault and Strasser bow shortly.

            Strasser looks at Renault sharply, but
            sees only a noncommittal smile on Renault's face. Laszlo remains standing at the
            table as Strasser and Renault leave.

             Ilsa smiles back at him,
            but her eyes are still troubled. On the floor, CORINA strums a guitar and begins
            her number. Meanwhile, Laszlo looks about with apparent casualness. He sees
            Strasser and Renault whispering together, then notices Berger at the bar.
            
            <span class="speaker las">LASZLO</span>

            He rises and goes off. We see Ilsa's troubled profile.
            While Corinna sings, Sam gives a worried glance in Ilsa's direction. Ilsa
            watches him. At the bar, Berger sips a drink. Laszlo walks up and casually takes
            a place at the bar next to Berger.

            <span class="speaker las">LASZLO</span>

             He stops when Sacha brings
            the drink to Laszlo. Corina finishes her song, and the crowd applauds quite
            enthusiastically. Ilsa sits alone at her table.

             Sam wheels in the piano to Ilsa's table. On his face is that funny
            fear. Ilsa herself is not as self-possessed as she tries to appear. There is
            something behind this, some mystery.

            Rick comes swinging out. He's heard the music and he's livid.

            Sam stops playing. Two close-ups reveal Ilsa and Rick seeing each other. Rick
            appears shocked. For a long moment he just looks at her. Sam prepares to move
            the piano away. Renault and Laszlo approach the table from the bar.

               Time Goes By." Ilsa seems unnerved. There is evidently something on her mind. Rick
               pours the champagne. His manner is wry, but not the bitter wryness we have seen in

               suitcase down and glances at his watch. A conductor calls out "All aboard, last
               train leaving in three minutes." Rain pours over his head and shoulders, but he
               doesn't seem to notice. He nervously checks his watch again. Suddenly Sam appears.

            the letter. 
            INSERT LETTER Richard, I cannot go with you or ever see you again. You must not ask

             Sam pulls a stunned, reluctant Rick to the train. The train starts to move just as
            he boards. From the steps he looks off into the distance, then crumbles the letter
            and tosses it away as the steam from the engine clouds over him.

            As the European hurries away, Carl checks all his pockets to make sure nothing is
            missing. Sam and Corina play a number, accompanied by the orchestra. Strasser and
            his crowd enter the cafe and pass Rick's table. Carl brings Rick a bottle and glass.

            demoralized to move. While Rick checks the reservation list, Ilsa and Laszlo enter
            the cafe. In the background we hear Sam playing, ironically enough, "It Had to Be
            You." Rick greets Ilsa and Laszlo.

            Rick walks over to Sam and whispers something to him. Sam stops what he is playing
            and begins "As Time Goes By." He shakes his head as Rick leaves. A waiter appears
            at
            Ilsa and Laszlo's table.

            "Marseillaise" continues, however. Yvonne jumps up and sings with tears in her eyes.
            Ilsa, overcome with emotion, looks proudly at Laszlo, who sings with passion.
            Finally the whole cafe stands, singing, their faces aglow. The song finishes on a

            She looks at him, understanding what he means. He bows and exits as Laszlo arrives
            at the table. They start out of the cafe.

            She gets up and follows him to the door. He opens it. In the slit of light from the
            hall we see Ilsa's face, now strained and worried. She hesitates for a moment, then.
            
            
            <span class="speaker ilsa">ILSA</span>

            He kisses her on the cheek and goes out the door. She stands there for a few
            seconds, then crosses to look out of the window. The figure in the archway is gone.
            She sees Victor walking down the street and closes the blind again. Ilsa gets a
            cloak from the bedroom, and leaves the hotel room.

               They needed him in Prague, but there the Gestapo were waiting for him. Just a

            <span class="diag"> But you haven't any actual proof, and you know it. This isn't Germany or
               occupied France. All you can do is fine him a few thousand francs and give him
               thirty days. You might as well let him go now. </span>
            
            
            <span class="speaker ren">RENAULT</span>
            <span class="diag"> Ricky, I'd advise you not to be too interested in what happens to Laszlo. If
               by any chance you were to help him escape -- </span>

            <span class="speaker ren">RENAULT</span>
            <span class="diag"> Because one, you've bet ten thousand francs he'd escape. Two, you have the
               letters of transit, now don't bother to deny it. And, well, you might do it
               simply because you don't like Strasser's looks. As a matter of fact, I don't
               like him either. </span>
            
            
            <span class="speaker rick">RICK</span>
            <span class="diag"> Well, they're all excellent reasons. </span>
            
            
            <span class="speaker ren">RENAULT</span>
            <span class="diag"> Don't count too much on my friendship, Ricky. In this matter I'm powerless.
               Besides, I might lose ten thousand francs. </span>
            
            
            <span class="speaker rick">RICK</span>
            <span class="diag"> You're not very subtle, but you are effective. I, I get the point. Yes, I
               have the letters, but I intend using them myself. I'm leaving Casablanca on
               tonight's plane, the last plane. </span>
            
            
            <span class="speaker ren">RENAULT</span>

            <span class="speaker rick">RICK</span>
            <span class="diag"> Ilsa Lund. pause That ought to put your mind to rest about my
               helping Laszlo escape. The last man I want to see in America. </span>
            
            
            <span class="speaker ren">RENAULT</span>
            <span class="diag"> You didn't come here to tell me this. You have the letters of transit. You
               can fill in your name and hers and leave any time you please. Why are you
               interested in what happens to Laszlo? </span>
            
            
            Renault gets out of his chair and crosses to the front of his desk. 
            
            <span class="speaker rick">RICK</span>
            <span class="diag"> I'm not. But I am interested in what happens to Ilsa and me. We have a legal
               right to go, that's true. But people have been held in Casablanca in spite of
               their legal rights. </span>
            
            Renault retrieves a fresh cigarette from a box on his desk. 
            
            
            <span class="speaker ren">RENAULT</span>
            <span class="diag"> What makes you think we want to hold you? </span>
            
            Renault chain-lights his new cigarette with the old one. 
            
            
            <span class="speaker rick">RICK</span>
            <span class="diag"> Ilsa is Laszlo's wife. She probably knows things that Strasser would like to
               know. Louis, I'll make a deal with you. Instead of this petty charge you have
               against him, you can get something really big, something that would chuck him in
               a concentration camp for years. That would be quite a feather in your cap,
               wouldn't it? </span>
            
            
            <span class="speaker ren">RENAULT</span>

            <span class="speaker rick">RICK</span>
            <span class="diag"> Then release him. You be at my place a half hour before the plane leaves. </span>
            
            
            Renault sits back down in his chair. 
            
            <span class="speaker rick">RICK</span>
            <span class="diag"> I'll arrange to have Laszlo come there to pick up the letters of transit, and
               that'll give you the criminal grounds on which to make the arrest. You get him,
               and we get away. To the Germans that last will be just a minor annoyance.

               puzzled There's still something about this business I don't quite
               understand. Miss Lund, she's very beautiful, yes, but you were never interested
               in any woman. </span>
            
            
            <span class="speaker rick">RICK</span>
            <span class="diag"> Well, she isn't just any woman. </span>
            
            Rick stares at the floor, then looks back up at Renault. 
            
            
            <span class="speaker ren">RENAULT</span>
            <span class="diag"> I see. How do I know you'll keep your end of the bargain? </span>

            <span class="speaker ren">RENAULT</span>
            <span class="diag"> Ricky, I'm going to miss you. Apparently you're the only one in Casablanca
               who has even less scruples than I. </span>
            
            
            <span class="speaker rick">RICK</span>

            Renault presses a button on his desk, triggering a BUZZER. The door to Renault's
            office opens. Rick rises to go.
            
            <span class="speaker rick">RICK</span>
            <span class="diag"> And by the way, call off your watchdogs when you let him go. I don't want

            <span class="diag"> Victor Laszlo! </span>
            
            
            All three hear footsteps and turn to see Renault walking towards them from the
            bottom of the stairs. 
            
            <span class="speaker ren">RENAULT</span>
            <span class="diag"> Victor Laszlo, you are under arrest -- as he walks toward them
               on a charge of accessory to the murder of the couriers from whom these letters
               were stolen. </span>
            
            
            Ilsa and Laszlo are both caught completely off guard. They turn towards Rick,
            bewildered. Horror is in Ilsa's eyes. Renault takes the letters. 
            
            <span class="speaker ren">RENAULT</span>
            <span class="diag"> Oh, you are surprised about my friend Ricky? </span>
            
            
            Obviously the situation delights Renault. He smiles as he turns toward Rick. 
            
            <span class="speaker ren">RENAULT</span>
            <span class="diag"> The explanation is quite simple. Love, it seems, has triumphed over virtue.
               Thank -- </span>
            
            
            Suddenly the smile fades. In Rick's hand is a gun, which he levels at
            Renault.
            
            <span class="speaker rick">RICK</span>
            <span class="diag"> -- Not so fast, Louis. Nobody's going to be arrested. Not for a while yet.

            <span class="diag"> Put that gun down. </span>
            
            
            Renault then walks toward Rick. Rick puts out his arm to stop him. 
            
            <span class="speaker rick">RICK</span>
            <span class="diag"> Louis, I wouldn't like to shoot you, but I will, if you take one more step. </span>
            
            
            Renault halts for a moment and studies Rick.
            
            <span class="speaker ren">RENAULT</span>
            <span class="diag"> Under the circumstances, I will sit down. </span>
            
            He walks to a table and sits. 
            
            
            <span class="speaker rick">RICK</span>

            He takes out a cigarette case. 
            
            
            <span class="speaker ren">RENAULT</span>
            <span class="diag"> I suppose you know what you're doing, but I wonder if you realize what this

            As Renault picks up the phone and dials, Rick takes back the letters.

            The door to the plane is closed by an attendant and it slowly taxies down the

             Strasser watches the plane in agony. His eyes dart towards the telephone. He runs
            toward it and desperately grabs the receiver.
            <span class="speaker str"> STRASSER</span><span class="diag"> Hello? </span>

            Strasser, one hand holding the receiver, pulls out a pistol with the other
            hand, and SHOOTS quickly at Rick. The bullet misses its mark. Rick now SHOOTS at
            Strasser, who crumples to the ground. At the sound of an approaching car both men
            turn. A police car SPEEDS in and comes to a stop near Renault. Four gendarmes
            hurriedly jump out. In the distance the plane turns onto the runway. The gendarmes
            run to Renault. The first one hurriedly salutes him. 
            <span class="speaker gen">GENDARME</span><span class="diag"> Mon Capitaine! </span>
            <span class="speaker ren">RENAULT</span><span class="diag"> Major Strasser's been shot. </span>
            
            Renault pauses and looks at Rick. Rick returns Renault's gaze with expressionless

            <span class="speaker gen">GENDARME</span><span class="diag"> Oui, mon Capitaine. </span>
            
            The gendarmes take Strasser's body away and then drive off. Renault walks inside
            the hangar, picks up a bottle of Vichy water, and opens it. 
            <span class="speaker ren">RENAULT</span><span class="diag"> Well, Rick, you're not only a
               sentimentalist, but you've become a patriot. </span>

            As he pours the water into a glass, Renault sees the Vichy label and quickly DROPS
            the bottle into a trash basket which he then KICKS over. He walks over and stands
            beside Rick. They both watch the plane take off, maintaining their gaze until it
            disappears into the clouds. Rick and Louis slowly walk away from the hangar toward
            the runway.

            (V.O.) With the coming of the Second World War, many eyes in imprisoned Europe turned
            hopefully, or desperately, toward the freedom of the Americas. Lisbon became the great
            embarkation point. But not everybody could get to Lisbon directly, and so, a tortuous,
            roundabout refugee trail sprang up. Paris to Marseilles, across the Mediterranean
            to Oran,
            then by train, or auto, or foot, across the rim of Africa to Casablanca in French
            Morocco.
            Here, the fortunate ones, through money, or influence, or luck, might obtain exit
            visas and
            scurry to Lisbon, and from Lisbon to the New World. But the others wait in Casablanca
            -- and

               nightclub which definitely possesses an air of sophistication and intrigue. SAM, a
               middle-aged Negro, sits on a stool before a small, salmon-colored piano on wheels,
               playing and singing while accompanied by a small orchestra. All about him there is
               the
               HUM of voices, CHATTER and LAUGHTER. The occupants of the room are varied. There are
               Europeans in their dinner jackets, their women beautifully begowned and bejeweled.
               There
               are Moroccans in silk robes. Turks wearing fezzes. Levantines. Naval officers. Members

               a
               friendly young Russian bartender, hands a drink to a customer with the Russian
               equivalent of "Bottoms Up." The customer answers with "Cheerio." CARL, the waiter,
               is a fat, jovial German refugee with spectacles. He walks, tray in hand, to a

               but nothing more. The overseer places a check on the table. The hand picks up the
               check and writes on it, in pencil, "Okay-Rick." The overseer takes the check. We now
               see RICK, sitting at a table alone playing solitaire chess. Rick is an American of
               indeterminate age. There is no expression on his face, complete deadpan. There is
               a
               commotion at the door as people attempt to come into the gambling room. He nods
               approval to Abdul. Then a GERMAN appears in the doorway. Abdul looks to Rick who
               glances back toward the open door and nods "no". Abdul starts to close the door on
               the man. </span>

               to
               squeeze through the doorway blocked by the German. If he were an American, Ugarte
               would look like a tout. He gets through and passes Rick. </span>

               last train from Paris. Rick appears in the crowd. He stops and puts his suitcase down
               and glances at his watch. A conductor calls out "All aboard, last train leaving in
               three
               minutes." Rain pours over his head and shoulders, but he doesn't seem to notice. He
               nervously checks his watch again. Suddenly Sam appears. </div>

               as

               shoot you. Strasser watches the plane in agony. His eyes dart towards the telephone.
               He runs toward it and desperately grabs the receiver. </span>
            <span class="speaker ">STRASSER</span><span class="diag"> Hello? </span>

            <span class="speaker ">RICK</span><span class="diag"> Put it down! Strasser, one hand holding the receiver,
               pulls out a pistol with the other hand, and SHOOTS quickly at Rick. The bullet
               misses its mark. Rick now SHOOTS at Strasser, who crumples to the ground. At the
               sound of an approaching car both men turn. A police car SPEEDS in and comes to a
               stop near Renault. Four gendarmes hurriedly jump out. In the distance the plane
               turns onto the runway. The gendarmes run to Renault. The first one hurriedly salutes

            <span class="speaker ">GENDARME</span><span class="diag"> Oui, mon Capitaine. The gendarmes take Strasser's body
               away and then drive off. Renault walks inside the hangar, picks up a bottle of Vichy
               water, and opens it. </span>
            <span class="speaker ">RENAULT</span><span class="diag"> Well, Rick, you're not only a sentimentalist, but
               you've become a patriot. </span>

               </span>
            <span class="speaker ">RENAULT</span><span class="diag"> I think perhaps you're right. As he pours the water
               into a glass, Renault sees the Vichy label and quickly DROPS the bottle into a trash
               basket which he then KICKS over. He walks over and stands beside Rick. They both
               watch the plane take off, maintaining their gaze until it disappears into the
               clouds. Rick and Louis slowly walk away from the hangar toward the runway.

            <span class="speaker ">RENAULT</span><span class="diag"> It might be a good idea for you to disappear from
               Casablanca for a while. There's a Free French garrison over at Brazzaville. I could

            <span class="speaker ">RENAULT</span><span class="diag"> And that ten thousand francs should pay our expenses.
