            EXT. RICK'S CAFE - NIGHT Ilsa and Laszlo leave the cafe. 
            
                LASZLO
                 A very puzzling fellow, this Rick. What sort is he? 
            
             Ilsa doesn't look at him. 
            
                ILSA
                 Oh, I really can't say, though I saw him quite often in Paris.
            
             They join Renault at the curb. 
            
                RENAULT
                 Tomorrow at ten at the Prefect's office. 
            
            
                LASZLO
                 We'll be there. 
            
            
                RENAULT
                 Goodnight. 
            
            
                ILSA
                 Goodnight. 
            
            
                LASZLO
                 Goodnight.
            
             They get into a waiting cab, leaving Renault on the curb, smoking and looking
                bemused. The neon sign goes off and the doorway is now illuminated by the revolving
                beacon from the airport. 
        
        
            CUT TO:
            INT. RICK'S CAFE - MAIN ROOM - NIGHT The customers have all gone. The house
                lights are out. Rick sits alone at a table. There is a glass of bourbon on the table
                directly in front of him, and another empty glass on the table before an empty
                chair. Near at hand is a bottle. He fills his glass and drinks it quickly. Rick just
                sits. His face is entirely expressionless. The beacon light from the airport sweeps
                around the room creating a mood of unreality. Sam comes in and stands hesitantly
                beside Rick. 
            
                SAM
                 Boss.
                 No answer, as Rick drinks. 
            
            
                SAM
                 Boss! 
            
            
                RICK
                 Yeah? 
            
            
                SAM
                 Boss, ain't you going to bed? 
            
            
                RICK
                 Not right now.
            
             Sam now realizes Rick is in a very grim mood. 
            
                SAM
                
                    lightly Ain't you planning on going to bed in the near future?
                
            
            
                RICK
                 No. 
            
            
                SAM
                 You ever going to bed? 
            
            
                RICK
                 No. 
            
            
                SAM
                 Well, I ain't sleepy either. 
            
            
                RICK
                 Good. Then have a drink. 
            
            
                SAM
                 No. Not me, boss. 
            
            
                RICK
                 Then don't have a drink. 
            
            
                SAM
                 Boss, let's get out of here. 
            
            
                RICK
                
                    emphatically No, sir. I'm waiting for a lady. 
            
            
                SAM
                
                    earnestly Please, boss, let's go. Ain't nothing but trouble for
                    you here. 
            
            
                RICK
                 She's coming back. I know she's coming back. 
            
            
                SAM
                 We'll take the car and drive all night. We'll get drunk. We'll go fishing and
                    stay away until she's gone. 
            
            
                RICK
                 Shut up and go home, will you? 
            
            
                SAM
                
                    stubbornly No, sir. I'm staying right here.
            
             Sam sits down at the piano and starts to play softly, improvising. 
            
                RICK
                 They grab Ugarte and she walks in. Well, that's the way it goes. One in, one
                    out. Sam? 
            
            
                SAM
                 Yeah, boss? 
            
            
                RICK
                 Sam, if it's December 1941 in Casablanca, what time is it in New York?
                
            
            
                SAM
                 Uh, my watch stopped. 
            
            
                RICK
                 I bet they're asleep in New York. I'll bet they're asleep all over America.
                
            
             Suddenly he pounds the table and buries his head in his arms. Then he raises his
                head, trying to regain control. 
            
                RICK
                 Of all the gin joints in all the towns in all the world, she walks into
                    mine.
            
             He holds his head in his hands. 
            
                RICK
                 What's that you're playing? 
            
            
                SAM
                 Just a little something of my own. 
            
            
                RICK
                 Well, stop it. You know what I want to hear. 
            
            
                SAM
                 No, I don't. 
            
            
                RICK
                 You played it for her and you can play it for me. 
            
            
                SAM
                 Well, I don't think I can remember it. 
            
            
                RICK
                 If she can stand it, I can. Play it! 
            
            
                SAM
                 Yes, boss. 
            
             Sam starts to play "As Time Goes By." Rick just stares ahead as orchestra MUSIC
                slowly joins Sam's playing. 
        
        DISSOLVE TO: MONTAGE - PARIS IN THE SPRING A) The Arc de Triomphe from
            a distance. B) Rick drives a small, open car slowly along the boulevard. He puts his arm
            around Ilsa. The background scenery changes to a country road as she snuggles close to
            him and puts her head on his shoulder. C) An excursion boat on the Seine. Rick and Ilsa
            stand at the rail of the boat. They seem to be transported by each other as Ilsa laughs.

                RICK
                 Who are you really? And what were you before? What did you do and what did
                    you think? Huh? 
            
            
                ILSA
                 We said "no questions." 
            
            
                RICK
                 Here's looking at you, kid.
            
             They drink.

                RICK
                 In America they'd bring only a penny. I guess that's about all they're worth.

                 And I was wondering. 
            
            
                ILSA
                 Yes? 
            
            
                RICK
                 Why I'm so lucky. Why I should find you waiting for me to come along. 
            
            
                ILSA
                 Why there is no other man in my life?

                 I'm sorry for asking. I forgot we said "no questions."

                There is much excitement. Rick and Ilsa sit at a table. They buy a newspaper and
                begin to read it. Nearby, a group of frightened French people cluster around a
                loudspeaker on a wagon. A harsh voice barks out the tragic news of the Nazi push
                toward Paris. 
            
                RICK
                 Nothing can stop them now. Wednesday, Thursday at the latest, they'll be in

                 I'm on their blacklist already, their roll of honor. 
            
        
        
            CUT TO:
            INT. LA BELLE AURORE - AFTERNOON A small cafe in the Montmartre. A shadow on
                the floor reflects the cafe sign "La Belle Aurore." Rick, at the bar, gets glasses
                and a bottle of champagne. He walks over to Ilsa and Sam at the piano. Sam plays "As
                Time Goes By." Ilsa seems unnerved. There is evidently something on her mind. Rick
                pours the champagne. His manner is wry, but not the bitter wryness we have seen in
                Casablanca. 
            
                RICK
                 Henri wants us to finish this bottle and then three more. He says he'll water
                    his garden with champagne before he'll let the Germans drink any of it.
            
             Sam looks at his glass. 
            
                SAM
                 This sort of takes the sting out of being occupied, doesn't it, Mr. Richard?

            Suddenly a loudspeaker BLARES out something in German.
            Rick and Ilsa look at each other, then hurry to the window.

                 It's the Gestapo. They say they expect to be in Paris tomorrow. They are
                    telling us how to act when they come marching in.

                RICK
                 Yeah. It's pretty bad timing. Where were you, say, ten years ago? 
            
            
                ILSA
                 Ten years ago? Let's see-- pause as she thinks a bit --Yes. I was
                    having a brace put on my teeth. Where were you? 
            
            
                RICK
                 Looking for a job.
            
             Ilsa looks at him tenderly. Rick takes her in his arms, and kisses her hungrily.
                While they are locked in an embrace they hear the dull BOOM of cannons.

                    grimly Ah, that's the new German 77. And judging by the sound,
                    only about thirty-five miles away. 
            
             Another BOOM from the cannons.
            
                RICK
                 And getting closer every minute. Here. Drink up. We'll never finish the other
                    three. 
            
            
                SAM
                 The Germans'll be here pretty soon now, and they'll come looking for you. And
                    don't forget there's a price on your head.
            
             Ilsa reacts to this worriedly. 
            
                RICK
                 I left a note in my apartment. They'll know where to find me. 
            
             Ilsa looks at Rick.
            
                ILSA
                 Strange. I know so very little about you. 
            
            
                RICK
                 I know very little about you, just the fact that you had your teeth
                    straightened. 
            
             He chuckles. 
            
                ILSA
                 But be serious, darling. You are in danger and you must leave Paris. 
            
            
                RICK
                 No, no, no, no. We must leave. 
            
            
                ILSA
                
                    seriously Yes, of course, we -- 
            
            
                RICK
                 -- The train for Marseilles leaves at five o'clock. I'll pick you up at your
                    hotel at four-thirty. 
            
            
                ILSA
                
                    quickly No, no. Not at my hotel. I, uh, I have things to do in
                    the city before I leave. I'll meet you at the station, huh? 
            
            
                RICK
                 All right. At a quarter to five. a thought strikes him Say, why
                    don't we get married in Marseilles?
            
             Rick chuckles again. 
            
                ILSA
                
                    evasively That's too far ahead to plan. 
            
            
                RICK
                 Yes, I guess it is a little too far ahead. Well, let's see. What about the
                    engineer? Why can't he marry us on the train? 
            
            
                ILSA
                 Oh, darling! 
            
             Suddenly Ilsa turns away and starts to cry.
            
                RICK
                 Well, why not? The captain on a ship can. It doesn't seem fair that-- Hey,
                    hey, what's wrong, kid? 
            
            
                ILSA
                 I love you so much, and I hate this war so much. Oh, it's a crazy world.
                    Anything can happen. If you shouldn't get away, I mean, if, if something should
                    keep us apart, wherever they put you and wherever I'll be, I want you to know--
                
            
             She can't go on. She lifts her face to his. He kisses her gently. 
            
                ILSA
                 Kiss me. Kiss me as if it were the last time.
            
             He looks into her eyes, then he does kiss her as though it were going to be the
                last time. Her hand falls to the table and knocks over a glass. 
        
        
            CUT TO:
            INT. GARE DE LYON - NIGHT It's raining very hard at the train station. There is
                a hectic, fevered excitement, evident in the faces of the people that pass by. This
                is the last train from Paris. Rick appears in the crowd. He stops and puts his
                suitcase down and glances at his watch. A conductor calls out "All aboard, last
                train leaving in three minutes." Rain pours over his head and shoulders, but he
                doesn't seem to notice. He nervously checks his watch again. Suddenly Sam appears. 
            
                RICK
                 Where is she? Have you seen her? 
            
            
                SAM
                 No, Mr. Richard. I can't find her. She checked out of the hotel. But this
                    note came just after you left.
            
             Sam pulls an envelope from his pocket. Rick grabs it, opens it, and stares down at
                the letter. 
            INSERT LETTER Richard, I cannot go with you or ever see you again. You must not ask
                why. Just believe that I love you. Go, my darling, and God bless you. Ilsa 
             Raindrops pour down the letter, smudging the writing. 
            BACK TO SCENE
             A whistle BLOWS. 
            
                SAM
                
                    frantically That's the last call, Mr. Richard, do you hear me?
                    Come on, Mr. Richard. Let's get out of here. Come on, Mr. Richard, come
                    on.
            
             Sam pulls a stunned, reluctant Rick to the train. The train starts to move just as
                he boards. From the steps he looks off into the distance, then crumbles the letter
                and tosses it away as the steam from the engine clouds over him. 
        
        
            DISSOLVE TO:
            INT. RICK'S CAFE - MAIN ROOM - NIGHT Close-up of a glass on the table in the
                cafe. Rick's hand reaches for it and knocks it over. We now see Rick's face and he's
                very drunk. Sam walks over to the table to pick up the glass and a fallen chair.
                Just then the door opens and it's Ilsa. Rick stares at the doorway. Ilsa lingers a
                moment, then comes over to the table. 
            
                ILSA
                 Rick, I have to talk to you.
            
             Her manner is a little uncertain, a little tentative, but with a quiet
                determination beneath it. 
            
                RICK
                 Oh. I saved my first drink to have with you. Here. 
            
            
                ILSA
                 No. No, Rick. Not tonight. 
            
            
                RICK
                 Especially tonight. 
            
             She sits down in the chair before the empty glass. Her eyes are searching his
                face, but there is no expression on it except a cold and impassive one. Rick reaches
                for the bottle, and pours himself another drink.
            
                ILSA
                 Please. 
            
            
                RICK
                 Why did you have to come to Casablanca? There are other places. 
            
            
                ILSA
                 I wouldn't have come if I had known that you were here. Believe me, Rick,
                    it's true. I didn't know. 
            
            
                RICK
                 It's funny about your voice, how it hasn't changed. I can still hear it.
                    "Richard dear, I'll go with you any place. We'll get on a train together and
                    never stop." 
            
            
                ILSA
                 Please don't. Don't, Rick. I can understand how you feel. 
            
            
                RICK
                 Huh! You understand how I feel. How long was it we had, honey? 
            
            
                ILSA
                 I didn't count the days. 
            
            
                RICK
                 Well, I did. Every one of them. Mostly I remember the last one. A wow finish.
                    A guy standing on a station platform in the rain with a comical look on his
                    face, because his insides had been kicked out. 
            
             He takes a drink.
            
                ILSA
                 Can I tell you a story, Rick? 
            
            
                RICK
                 Has it got a wow finish? 
            
            
                ILSA
                 I don't know the finish yet. 
            
            
                RICK
                 Well, go on, tell it. Maybe one will come to you as you go along. 
            
            
                ILSA
                 It's about a girl who had just come to Paris from her home in Oslo. At the
                    house of some friends she met a man about whom she'd heard her whole life, a
                    very great and courageous man. He opened up for her a whole beautiful world full
                    of knowledge and thoughts and ideals. Everything she knew or ever became was
                    because of him. And she looked up to him and worshipped him with a feeling she
                    supposed was love. 
            
            
                RICK
                 Yes, that's very pretty. I heard a story once. As a matter of fact, I've
                    heard a lot of stories in my time. They went along with the sound of a tinny
                    piano playing in the parlor downstairs, "Mister, I met a man once when I was a
                    kid," it'd always begin. Huh. I guess neither one of our stories was very funny.
                    Tell me, who was it you left me for? Was it Laszlo, or were there others in
                    between? Or aren't you the kind that tells? 
            
             Ilsa gets up and leaves. Rick's head slumps over the table. 
        
        
            CUT TO:
            INT. RENAULT'S OFFICE - MORNING A sign on the door reads: Captain Renault,
                Prefect de Police. Strasser sits while Renault attends to some paperwork. 
            
                STRASSER
                 I strongly suspect that Ugarte left the letters of transit with Mr. Blaine. I
                    would suggest you search the cafe immediately and thoroughly. 
            
            
                RENAULT
                 If Rick has the letters, he's much too smart to let you find them there.
                
            
            
                STRASSER
                 You give him credit for too much cleverness. My impression was that he's just
                    another blundering American. 
            
            
                RENAULT
                 But we mustn't underestimate American blundering. I was with them when they
                    "blundered" into Berlin in 1918. 
            
             Strasser looks at him.
            
                STRASSER
                 As to Laszlo, we want him watched twenty-four hours a day. 
            
            
                RENAULT
                
                    reassuringly It may interest you to know that at this very moment
                    he is on his way here.

                bows to them both. 
            
                RENAULT
                 I am delighted to see you both. Did you have a good night's rest? 
            
            
                LASZLO
                 I slept very well. 
            
            
                RENAULT
                 That's strange. Nobody is supposed to sleep well in Casablanca. 
            
            
                LASZLO
                
                    coldly May we proceed with the business? 
            
            
                RENAULT
                 With pleasure. Won't you sit down? 
            
            
                LASZLO
                 Thank you.
            
             They take their seats. 
            
                STRASSER
                
                    now as cold as Laszlo Very well, Herr Laszlo, we will not mince
                    words. You are an escaped prisoner of the Reich. So far you have been fortunate
                    enough in eluding us. You have reached Casablanca. It is my duty to see that you
                    stay in Casablanca. 
            
            
                LASZLO
                 Whether or not you succeed is, of course, problematical. 
            
            
                STRASSER
                 Not at all. Captain Renault's signature is necessary on every exit visa.
                        turns to Renault Captain, would you think it is possible that
                    Herr Laszlo will receive a visa? 
            
            
                RENAULT
                 I am afraid not. My regrets, Monsieur. 
            
            
                LASZLO
                 Well, perhaps I shall like it in Casablanca. 
            
            
                STRASSER
                 And Mademoiselle? 
            
            
                ILSA
                 You needn't be concerned about me.

                 Is that all you wish to tell us? 
            
            
                STRASSER
                 Don't be in such a hurry. You have all the time in the world. You may be in
                    Casablanca indefinitely-- or you may leave for Lisbon tomorrow, on one
                    condition.

                 Yes, even in Berlin. If you will furnish me with their names and their exact
                    whereabouts, you will have your visa in the morning.

                LASZLO
                 I was in a German concentration camp for a year. That's honor enough for a
                    lifetime. 
            
            
                STRASSER
                 You will give us the names? 
            
            
                LASZLO
                 If I didn't give them to you in a concentration camp where you had more
                    "persuasive methods" at your disposal, I certainly won't give them to you now.
                
            
             The passionate conviction in his voice now reveals the crusader.
            
                LASZLO
                 And what if you track down these men and kill them? What if you murdered all
                    of us? From every corner of Europe, hundreds, thousands, would rise to take our
                    places. Even Nazis can't kill that fast. 
            
            
                STRASSER
                 Herr Laszlo, you have a reputation for eloquence which I can now understand.
                    But in one respect you are mistaken. You said the enemies of the Reich could all
                    be replaced, but there is one exception. No one could take your place in the
                    event anything unfortunate should occur to you while you were trying to escape.
                
            
            
                LASZLO
                 You won't dare to interfere with me here. This is still unoccupied France.
                    Any violation of neutrality would reflect on Captain Renault. 
            
            
                RENAULT
                 Monsieur, insofar as it is in my power -- 
            
            
                LASZLO
                 -- Thank you. 
            
            
                RENAULT
                 By the way, Monsieur, last night you evinced an interest in Signor Ugarte.
                
            
            
                LASZLO
                 Yes. 
            
            
                RENAULT
                 I believe you have a message for him? 
            
            
                LASZLO
                 Nothing important, but may I speak to him now? 
            
            
                STRASSER
                 You would find the conversation a trifle one-sided. Signor Ugarte is dead.
                
            
             Close-ups of Ilsa, then Laszlo, reveal their disappointment. Strasser observes
                their reaction. 
            
                ILSA
                
                    softly Oh. Renault holds a report. 
            
            
                RENAULT
                 I am making out the report now. We haven't quite decided whether he committed
                    suicide or died trying to escape. 
            
            
                LASZLO
                 Are you quite finished with us? 
            
            
                STRASSER
                 For the time being. 
            
            
                LASZLO
                 Good day.
            
             Renault rings a buzzer and the door is opened for them. As Ilsa and Laszlo leave,
                an OFFICER comes in. 
            
                RENAULT
                 Undoubtedly their next step will be to the black market. 
            
            
                OFFICER
                 Excuse me, Captain. Another visa problem has come up. 
            
            
                RENAULT
                 Show her in. 
            
            
                OFFICER
                 Yes, sir.
            
             Renault looks at himself in the mirror and straightens his tie.

            EXT. BLACK MARKET - DAY The black market is a cluttered Arab street of bazaars,
                shops and stalls. All kinds and races of people mill about the merchandise which
                native dealers have on outdoor display. Both men and women are dressed in tropical
                clothes. The canopies over the stalls give them some protection from the scorching
                sun. On the surface the atmosphere is merely languid, but underneath lies the
                sinister workings of illicit trade. A FRENCHMAN and a NATIVE huddle together and
                talk in low tones. 
            
                NATIVE
                 I'm sorry, Monsieur, we would have to handle the police. This is a job for
                    Signor Ferrari. 
            
            
                FRENCHMAN
                 Ferrari? 
            
            
                NATIVE
                 It can be most helpful to know Signor Ferrari. He pretty near has a monopoly
                    on the black market here. You will find him over there at the Blue Parrot.
                
            
            
                FRENCHMAN

            INT. THE BLUE PARROT - DAY The cafe is much less pretentious than Rick's, but
                well populated. Rick enters and walks through the cafe toward Ferrari's office just
                as Ferrari emerges with Jan and Annina, who look very disappointed. 
            
                FERRARI
                 There, don't be too downhearted. Perhaps you can come to terms with Captain
                    Renault. 
            
            
                JAN
                 Thank you very much, Signor. 
            
             Jan leads Annina away.
            
                RICK
                 Hello, Ferrari.
            
             Signor Ferrari turns around. He's pleased to see Rick. 
            
                FERRARI
                 Ah, good morning, Rick.
            
             They shake hands. 
            
                RICK
                 I see the bus is in. I'll take my shipment with me. 
            
            
                FERRARI
                 No hurry. I'll have it sent over. Have a drink with me. 
            
            
                RICK
                 I never drink in the morning. And every time you send my shipment over, it's
                    always just a little bit short. 
            
            
                FERRARI
                
                    chuckling Carrying charges, my boy, carrying charges. Here, sit
                    down. There's something I want to talk over with you, anyhow.
            
             He hails a waiter. 
            
                FERRARI
                 The bourbon. to Rick, sighing deeply The news about Ugarte upset
                    me very much. 
            
            
                RICK
                 You're a fat hypocrite. You don't feel any sorrier for Ugarte than I
                    do.
            
             He eyes Rick closely. 
            
                FERRARI
                 Of course not. What upsets me is the fact that Ugarte is dead and no one
                    knows where those letters of transit are. 
            
            
                RICK
                 Practically no one. 
            
            
                FERRARI
                 If I could lay my hands on those letters, I could make a fortune. 
            
            
                RICK
                 So could I. And I'm a poor businessman. 
            
            
                FERRARI
                 I have a proposition for whoever has those letters. I will handle the entire
                    transaction, get rid of the letters, take all the risk, for a small percentage.
                
            
            
                RICK
                 And the carrying charges? 
            
            
                FERRARI
                 Naturally there will be a few incidental expenses. That is the proposition I
                    have for whoever has those letters. 
            
            
                RICK
                
                    dryly I'll tell him when he comes in. 
            
            
                FERRARI
                 Rick, I'll put my cards on the table. I think you know where those letters
                    are. 
            
            
                RICK
                 Well, you're in good company. Renault and Strasser probably think so,
                    too.
            
             Rick looks out of the window and sees Ilsa at the linen bazaar, then Laszlo
                walking toward the cafe. 
            
                RICK
                 That's why I came over here to give them a chance to ransack my place.
                
            
            
                FERRARI
                 Rick, don't be a fool. Take me into your confidence. You need a
                    partner.
            
             Rick isn't listening to him. He looks through the open window in the direction of
                the linen bazaar. Rick gets up. 
            
                RICK
                 Excuse me, I'll be getting back.

            EXT. THE BLUE PARROT - DAY Laszlo reaches the entrance to the cafe as Rick
                comes out. He stops and addresses Rick politely. 
            
                LASZLO
                 Good morning. 
            
            
                RICK
                 Signor Ferrari is the fat gent at the table.

            EXT. BLACK MARKET - DAY At the linen stall, Ilsa examines a tablecloth which an
                Arab vendor is endeavoring to sell. He holds a sign which reads "700 francs." 
            
                ARAB

                    seven hundred francs.
            
             Rick walks up behind Ilsa. 
            
                RICK
                 You're being cheated.
            
             She looks briefly at Rick, then turns away. Her manner is politely formal. 
            
                ILSA
                 It doesn't matter, thank you. 
            
            
                ARAB
                 Ah, the lady is a friend of Rick's? For friends of Rick we have a small
                    discount. Did I say seven hundred francs? You can have it for two
                    hundred.
            
             Reaching under the counter, he takes out a sign reading "200 francs", and replaces
                the other sign with it. 
            
                RICK
                 I'm sorry I was in no condition to receive you when you called on me last

                 Ah, for special friends of Rick's we have a special discount. One hundred
                    francs. 
            
            He replaces the second sign with a third which reads "100 francs." 
            
                RICK
                 Your story had me a little confused. Or maybe it was the bourbon.

             The Arab hurriedly exits. Ilsa pretends to examine the goods on the counter.
            
                RICK
                 Why did you come back? To tell me why you ran out on me at the railway

                 I don't think I will, Rick. 
            
            
                RICK
                 Why not? After all, I got stuck with a railway ticket. I think I'm entitled
                    to know.

                    tell him. He'd understand. But the one who looked at me with such hatred-- well,
                    I'll be leaving Casablanca soon and we'll never see each other again. We knew
                    very little about each other when we were in love in Paris. If we leave it that
                    way, maybe we'll remember those days and not Casablanca, not last night. 
            
            
                RICK
                 Did you run out on me because you couldn't take it? Because you knew what it
                    would be like, hiding from the police, running away all the time?

                 Well, I'm not running away any more. I'm settled now, above a saloon, it's
                    true, but-- walk up a flight. I'll be expecting you. 
            
            Ilsa turns her head away.

                 All the same, someday you'll lie to Laszlo. You'll be there. 
            
            
                ILSA
                 No, Rick. No, you see, Victor Laszlo is my husband-- and was, even when I
                    knew you in Paris.
            
             She walks away into the cafe as Rick stares after her in stunned disbelief.

            INT. THE BLUE PARROT - DAY Ilsa and Laszlo sit with Ferrari. 
            
                FERRARI
                 I was just telling Monsieur Laszlo that, unfortunately, I am not able to help
                    him. 
            
            
                ILSA
                 Oh. 
            
            
                LASZLO
                 You see, my dear, the word has gone around. 
            
            
                FERRARI
                
                    to Ilsa As leader of all illegal activities in Casablanca, I am an
                    influential and respected man. It would not be worth my life to do anything for
                    Monsieur Laszlo. You, however, are a different matter. 
            
            
                LASZLO
                 Signor Ferrari thinks it might just be possible to get an exit visa for you.
                
            
            
                ILSA
                 You mean for me to go on alone? 
            
            
                FERRARI
                 And only alone. 
            
            
                LASZLO
                 I will stay here and keep on trying. I'm sure in a little while -- 
            
            
                FERRARI
                 -- We might as well be frank, Monsieur. It will take a miracle to get you out
                    of Casablanca. And the Germans have outlawed miracles. 
            
            
                ILSA
                 We are only interested in two visas, Signor. 
            
            
                LASZLO
                 Please, Ilsa, don't be hasty. 
            
            
                ILSA
                
                    firmly No, Victor, no. 
            
            
                FERRARI
                 You two will want to discuss this. Excuse me. I'll be at the bar. 
            
            Ferrari gets to his feet and walks away.
            
                LASZLO
                 No, Ilsa, I won't let you stay here. You must get to America. And believe me,
                    somehow I will get out and join you. 
            
            
                ILSA
                 But, Victor, if the situation were different, if I had to stay and there were
                    only a visa for one, would you take it? 
            
            
                LASZLO
                
                    not very convincingly Yes, I would. 
            
            Ilsa smiles faintly. She doesn't believe it for even a moment.
            
                ILSA
                 Yes, I see. When I had trouble getting out of Lille, why didn't you leave me
                    there? And when I was sick in Marseilles and held you up for two weeks and you
                    were in danger every minute of the time, why didn't you leave me then? 
            
            
                LASZLO
                 I meant to, but something always held me up. I love you very much,
                    Ilsa.
            
             She smiles again. 
            
                ILSA
                 Your secret will be safe with me. Ferrari is waiting for our answer. 
            
            At the bar Ferrari talks to a waiter.
            
                FERRARI
                 Not more than fifty francs though. 
            
            Ilsa and Laszlo walk up to him.
            
                LASZLO
                 We've decided, Signor Ferrari. For the present we'll go on looking for two
                    exit visas. Thank you very much. 
            
            
                FERRARI
                 Well, good luck. But be careful. a flick of his eyes in the direction of
                        the bazaar You know you're being shadowed? 
            
            Laszlo glances in the direction of the bazaar. 
            
                LASZLO
                 Of course. It becomes an instinct. 
            
            Ferrari looks shrewdly at Ilsa.
            
                FERRARI
                 I observe that you in one respect are a very fortunate man, Monsieur. I am
                    moved to make one more suggestion, why, I do not know, because it cannot
                    possibly profit me, but, have you heard about Signor Ugarte and the letters of
                    transit? 
            
            
                LASZLO
                 Yes, something. 
            
            
                FERRARI
                 Those letters were not found on Ugarte when they arrested him. 
            
             There's a moments pause as this sinks in.
            
                LASZLO
                 Do you know where they are? 
            
            
                FERRARI
                 Not for sure, Monsieur, but I will venture to guess that Ugarte left those
                    letters with Monsieur Rick.
            
             Ilsa's face darkens. Laszlo quietly observes. 
            
                LASZLO
                 Rick? 
            
            
                FERRARI
                 He is a difficult customer, that Rick. One never knows what he'll do or why.
                    But it is worth a chance. 
            
            
                LASZLO
                 Thank you very much. Good day. 
            
            
                ILSA
                 Goodbye, thank you for your coffee, Signor. I shall miss that when we leave
                    Casablanca. 
            
             Ferrari bows.
            
                FERRARI
                 It was gracious of you to share it with me. Good day, Mademoiselle, Monsieur.
                
            
            
                LASZLO
                 Good day.
            
             As Ilsa and Laszlo leave the cafe, Ferrari nonchalantly swats a fly on a table.

                EUROPEAN
                 Oh, I'm sorry. 
            
            As the European hurries away, Carl checks all his pockets to make sure nothing is
                missing. Sam and Corina play a number, accompanied by the orchestra. Strasser and
                his crowd enter the cafe and pass Rick's table. Carl brings Rick a bottle and glass. 
            
                CARL
                 Monsieur Rick, you are getting to be your best customer. 
            
             Carl leaves. As Rick lights a cigarette, Renault shows up.
            
                RENAULT
                 Well, Ricky. I'm very pleased with you. Now you're beginning to live like a

                RICK
                 That was some going-over your men gave my place this afternoon. We just
                    barely got cleaned up in time to open.
            
             He pours a drink for Renault. 
            
                RENAULT
                 Well, I told Strasser he wouldn't find the letters here. But I told my men to
                    be especially destructive. You know how that impresses Germans? taking a
                        sip Rick, have you got these letters of transit?

                 Serves me right for asking a direct question. The subject is closed. 
            
            
                RICK
                 Well, it looks like you're a little late.

            Rick gazes at Yvonne and a GERMAN OFFICER approaching the bar.
            
                RICK
                 So Yvonne's gone over to the enemy. 
            
            
                RENAULT
                 Who knows? In her own way she may constitute an entire second front. I think
                    it's time for me to flatter Major Strasser a little. I'll see you later, Rick.
                
            
            Renault gets up and strolls away. At the bar, Yvonne and the German officer place
                their orders.

                GERMAN OFFICER

            There are exclamations from people nearby. German officers at a nearby table rise,
                ready to join in. Rick walks up and separates the two men. 
            
                RICK
                
                    to the German I don't like disturbances in my place. Either lay off

             Renault, Strasser and the other officers sit down again.
            
                STRASSER
                 You see, Captain, the situation is not as much under control as you believe.
                
            
            
                RENAULT
                 My dear Major, we are trying to cooperate with your government, but we cannot
                    regulate the feelings of our people. 
            
            Strasser eyes him closely. 
            
                STRASSER
                 Captain Renault, are you entirely certain which side you're on? 
            
            
                RENAULT
                 I have no conviction, if that's what you mean. I blow with the wind, and the
                    prevailing wind happens to be from Vichy. 
            
            
                STRASSER
                 And if it should change? 
            
            He smiles. 
            
                RENAULT
                 Surely the Reich doesn't admit that possibility? 
            
            Renault lights a cigarette and puffs away.
            
                STRASSER
                 We are concerned about more than Casablanca. We know that every French
                    province in Africa is honey-combed with traitors waiting for their chance,
                    waiting, perhaps, for a leader. 
            
            
                RENAULT
                
                    casually A leader, like Laszlo? 
            
            
                STRASSER
                 Uh, huh. I have been thinking. It is too dangerous if we let him go. It may
                    be too dangerous if we let him stay. 
            
            
                RENAULT
                
                    thoughtfully I see what you mean. Carl, bottle in hand,
                    approaches the table of a middle-aged German couple, the LEUCHTAGS. 
            
            
                CARL
                
                    in German I brought you the finest brandy. Only the employees drink
                    it here.
            
             He pours a drink for each of them.
            
                MR. LEUCHTAG 
                Thank you, Carl.
            
            
                CARL
                
                    as he pours For Mrs. Leuchtag. 
            
            
                MRS. LEUCHTAG 
                Thank you, Carl.
            
            
                CARL
                 For Mr. Leuchtag. 
            
            
                MR. LEUCHTAG
                Carl, sit down. Have a brandy with us. MRS. LEUCHTAG beaming with happiness To
                    celebrate our leaving for America tomorrow. Carl sits down.
            
            
                CARL
                 Thank you very much. I thought you would ask me, so I brought the good brandy
                    and a third glass.
            
            He produces a glass from a back pocket. 
            
                MRS. LEUCHTAG
                At last the day has come.
            
            
                MR. LEUCHTAG
                 Frau Leuchtag and I are speaking nothing but English now.
            
            
                MRS. LEUCHTAG
                So we should feel at home ven ve get to America.
            
            
                CARL
                 A very nice idea.
            
            
                MR. LEUCHTAG 
                raising his glass
                 To America.
            
            Mrs. Leuchtag and Carl repeat "To America." They clink glasses and drink.
            
                MR. LEUCHTAG
                Liebchen, uh, sweetness heart, what watch?
            
             She glances at her wristwatch.
            
                MRS. LEUCHTAG 
                Ten watch.
            
            
                MR. LEUCHTAG
                surprised
                 Such much?
            
            
                CARL
                 Er, you will get along beautifully in America, huh. 
            
             Annina meets Renault in the hallway as she leaves the gambling room,
            
                RENAULT
                 How's lady luck treating you? Aw, too bad. You'll find him over there.
                
            
            Annina sees Rick and goes to his table.
            
                ANNINA
                 Monsieur Rick? 
            
            
                RICK
                 Yes? 
            
            
                ANNINA
                 Could I speak to you for just a moment, please? 
            
             Rick looks at her.
            
                RICK
                 How did you get in here? You're under age. 
            
            
                ANNINA
                 I came with Captain Renault. 
            
            
                RICK
                
                    cynically I should have known. 
            
            
                ANNINA
                 My husband is with me, too. 
            
            
                RICK
                 He is? Well, Captain Renault's getting broadminded. Sit down. Will you have a
                    drink? 
            
            Annina shakes her head. 
            
                RICK
                 No, of course not. Do you mind if I do? 
            
            
                ANNINA
                 No. 
            
            Rick pours himself a drink
            
                ANNINA
                 Monsieur Rick, what kind of man is Captain Renault? 
            
            
                RICK
                 Oh, he's just like any other man, only more so. 
            
            
                ANNINA
                 No, I mean, is he trustworthy? Is his word -- 
            
            
                RICK
                 -- Now, just a minute. Who told you to ask me that? 
            
            
                ANNINA
                 He did. Captain Renault did. 
            
            
                RICK
                 I thought so. Where's your husband? 
            
            
                ANNINA
                 At the roulette table, trying to win enough for our exit visa. Well of
                    course, he's losing. 
            
             Rick looks at her closely.
            
                RICK
                 How long have you been married? 
            
            
                ANNINA
                 Eight weeks. We come from Bulgaria. Oh, things are very bad there, Monsieur.
                    A devil has the people by the throat. So, Jan and I, we, we do not want our
                    children to grow up in such a country. 
            
            
                RICK
                
                    wearily So you decided to go to America. 
            
            
                ANNINA
                 Yes, but we have not much money, and travelling is so expensive and
                    difficult. It was much more than we thought to get here. And then Captain
                    Renault sees us and he is so kind. He wants to help us. 
            
            
                RICK
                 Yes, I'll bet. 
            
            
                ANNINA
                 He tells me he can give us an exit visa, but we have no money. 
            
            
                RICK
                 Does he know that? 
            
            
                ANNINA
                 Oh, yes. 
            
            
                RICK
                 And he is still willing to give you a visa? 
            
            
                ANNINA
                 Yes, Monsieur. 
            
            
                RICK
                 And you want to know -- 
            
            
                ANNINA
                 -- Will he keep his word? 
            
            
                RICK
                 He always has.
            
             There is a silence. Annina is very disturbed. 
            
                ANNINA
                 Oh, Monsieur, you are a man. If someone loved you very much, so that your
                    happiness was the only thing that she wanted in the whole world, but she did a
                    bad thing to make certain of it, could you forgive her? 
            
            Rick stares off into space. 
            
                RICK
                 Nobody ever loved me that much. 
            
            
                ANNINA
                 And he never knew, and the girl kept this bad thing locked in her heart? That
                    would be all right, wouldn't it? 
            
            
                RICK
                
                    harshly You want my advice? 
            
            
                ANNINA
                 Oh, yes, please. 
            
            
                RICK
                 Go back to Bulgaria. 
            
            
                ANNINA
                 Oh, but if you knew what it means to us to leave Europe, to get to America!
                    Oh, but if Jan should find out! He is such a boy. In many ways I am so much
                    older than he is. 
            
            
                RICK
                 Yes, well, everybody in Casablanca has problems. Yours may work out. You'll
                    excuse me. 
            
            Rick abruptly rises. 
            
                ANNINA
                
                    tonelessly Thank you, Monsieur.
            
            He quickly goes off, leaving Annina alone at the table. She remains seated, too
                demoralized to move. While Rick checks the reservation list, Ilsa and Laszlo enter
                the cafe. In the background we hear Sam playing, ironically enough, "It Had to Be
                You." Rick greets Ilsa and Laszlo.
            
                RICK
                 Good evening. 
            
            
                LASZLO
                 Good evening. You see, here we are again. 
            
            
                RICK
                 I take that as a great compliment to Sam. to Ilsa I suppose he
                    means to you Paris of, well, happier days. 
            
            Laszlo looks around. 
            
                ILSA
                
                    quietly He does. Could we have a table close to him? 
            
            
                LASZLO
                 And as far away from Major Strasser as possible. 
            
            
                RICK
                 Well, the geography may be a little difficult to arrange.
            
             Rick snaps his fingers for the headwaiter. 
            
                RICK
                 Paul! Table thirty! 
            
            
                HEADWAITER
                
                    to Ilsa and Laszlo Yes, sir. Right this way, if you please. 
            
            
                RICK
                 to Ilsa I'll have Sam play "As Time Goes By." I believe that's
                    your favorite tune. 
            
            
                ILSA
                
                    smiling Thank you. 
            
            
                LASZLO
                 Two cognacs, please. 
            
            Rick walks over to Sam and whispers something to him. Sam stops what he is playing
                and begins "As Time Goes By." He shakes his head as Rick leaves. A waiter appears at
                Ilsa and Laszlo's table.
        

        
            CUT TO:
            INT. RICK'S CAFE - GAMBLING ROOM - NIGHT Jan sits at the roulette table. He has
                only three chips left and seems bewildered. As Rick comes up the croupier speaks to
                Jan. 
            
                CROUPIER
                 Do you wish to place another bet, sir? 
            
            
                JAN
                 No, no, I guess not. 
            
            Rick stands behind Jan.
            
                RICK
                
                    to Jan Have you tried twenty-two tonight? I said, twenty-two. 
            
            Jan looks at Rick, then at the chips in his hand. He pauses, then puts the chips on
                twenty-two. Rick and the croupier exchange looks. The croupier understands what Rick
                wants him to do. He spins the wheel. Carl follows the proceedings, fascinated. The
                wheel stops spinning. 
            
                CROUPIER
                
                    in French Twenty-two, black, twenty-two. A winner. Renault, at a
                    nearby table, takes notice of what is happening. The croupier pushes a pile of
                    chips onto twenty-two and Jan reaches for it. 
            
            
                RICK
                
                    not even looking at Jan Leave it there. Jan hesitates, then withdraws
                    his hands. Carl continues to watch. The wheel spins. Nobody speaks while it
                    spins. It stops. 
            
            
                CROUPIER
                 Twenty-two, black. Another winner. The croupier shoves a pile of chips toward
                    Jan. 
            
            
                RICK
                
                    to Jan Cash it in and don't come back. 
            
            Jan rises to go to the cashier. A CUSTOMER complains to Carl.
            
                CUSTOMER
                 Say, are you sure this place is honest? 
            
            
                CARL
                
                    fervently Honest! As honest as the day is long! 
            
            Meanwhile, Rick has walked over to the croupier. 
            
                RICK
                 How we doing tonight? 
            
            
                CROUPIER
                 Well, a couple of thousand less than I thought there would be.
            
             Rick smiles slightly and goes toward the door. Annina runs up to him and hugs him. 
            
                ANNINA
                 Monsieur Rick, I -- 
            
            
                RICK
                 -- He's just a lucky guy. 
            
            
                CARL
                
                    solicitously Monsieur Rick, may I get you a cup of coffee?
                
            
            
                RICK
                 No thanks, Carl. 
            
            
                CARL
                 Monsieur Rick! 
            
            Renault, seeing that Jan has won, gets up from his table to follow Rick. Jan and
                Annina stop him on the way.
            
                JAN
                 Captain Renault, may I -- 
            
            
                RENAULT
                 -- Oh, not here, please. Come to my office in the morning. We'll do
                    everything business-like. 
            
            
                JAN
                 We'll be there at six. 
            
            
                RENAULT
                 I'll be there at ten. I am very happy for both of you. Still, it's very
                    strange that you won. 
            
            He looks over and sees Rick. 
            
                RENAULT
                 Well, maybe not so strange. I'll see you in the morning. 
            
            
                ANNINA
                 Thank you so much, Captain Renault. 
            
        
        
            CUT TO:
            INT. RICK'S CAFE - MAIN ROOM - NIGHT At the bar, Carl whispers in Sacha's ear.
                Sacha says "No!" and runs to Rick. 
            
                SACHA
                 Boss, you've done a beautiful thing. 
            
            He kisses Rick on both cheeks.
            
                RICK
                 Go away, you crazy Russian!
            
             Carl pours a brandy for Rick. Pretending not to do so, Rick glances in Ilsa's
                direction. Renault comes up to him. 
            
                RENAULT
                 As I suspected, you're a rank sentimentalist. 
            
            
                RICK
                 Yeah? Why? 
            
            
                RENAULT
                
                    chidingly Why do you interfere with my little romances? 
            
            
                RICK
                 Put it down as a gesture to love. 
            
            
                RENAULT
                
                    good-naturedly Well, I forgive you this time. But I'll be in
                    tomorrow night with a breathtaking blonde, and it will make me very happy if she
                    loses. Uh huh! 
            
             He smiles and walks away. Laszlo comes up to Rick. 
            
                LASZLO
                 Monsieur Blaine, I wonder if I could talk to you? 
            
            
                RICK
                 Go ahead. 
            
            
                LASZLO
                 Well, isn't there some other place? It's rather confidential, what I have to
                    say. 
            
            
                RICK
                 My office. 
            
            
                LASZLO
                 Right.
