    FADE IN:
INSERT - A revolving globe. When it stops revolving it turns briefly into a contour map of Europe, then into a flat map.
Superimposed over this map are scenes of refugees fleeing from all sections of Europe by foot, wagon, auto, and boat, and all converging upon one point on the tip of Africa -- Casablanca.
Arrows on the map illustrate the routes taken as the voice of a NARRATOR describes the migration.
NARRATOR (V.O.)
With the coming of the Second World War, many eyes in imprisoned Europe turned hopefully, or desperately, toward the freedom of the Americas. Lisbon became the great embarkation point. But not everybody could get to Lisbon directly, and so, a tortuous, roundabout refugee trail sprang up. Paris to Marseilles, across the Mediterranean to Oran, then by train, or auto, or foot, across the rim of Africa to Casablanca in French Morocco. Here, the fortunate ones, through money, or influence, or luck, might obtain exit visas and scurry to Lisbon, and from Lisbon to the New World. But the others wait in Casablanca -- and wait -- and wait -- and wait.
The narrator's voice fade away...
CUT TO:
EXT. OLD MOORISH SECTION OF THE CITY - DAY
At first only the turrets and rooftops are visible against a torrid sky.
The facades of the Moorish buildings give way to a narrow, twisting street crowded with the polyglot life of a native quarter. The intense desert sun holds the scene in a torpid tranquility. Activity is unhurried and sounds are muted.
CUT TO:
INT. POLICE STATION - DAY
A POLICE OFFICER takes a piece of paper from the typewriter, turns to a microphone, and reads.
POLICE OFFICER
To all officers! Two German couriers carrying important official documents murdered on train from Oran. Murderer and possible accomplices headed for Casablanca. Round up all suspicious characters and search them for stolen documents. Important!
CUT TO:
EXT. A STREET IN THE OLD MOORISH SECTION - DAY
An officer BLOWS his whistle several times.
There is pandemonium as native guards begin to round up people.
A police car, full of officers, with SIREN BLARING, screams through the street and stops in the market.
Some try to escape but are caught by the police and loaded into a police wagon.
At a street corner TWO POLICEMEN stop a white CIVILIAN and question him.
FIRST POLICEMAN
May we see your papers?
CIVILIAN
nervously
I don't think I have them on me.
FIRST POLICEMAN
In that case, we'll have to ask you to come along.
The civilian pats his pockets.
CIVILIAN
Wait. It's just possible that I -- Yes, here they are.
He brings out his papers. The second policeman examines them.
SECOND POLICEMAN
These papers expired three weeks ago. You'll have to come along.
Suddenly the civilian breaks away and starts to run wildly down the street.
The policeman SHOUTS "Halt", but the civilian keeps going.
JAN and ANNINA BRANDEL, a very young and attractive refugee couple from Bulgaria, watch as the civilian passes. They've been thrust by circumstances from a simple country life into an unfamiliar and hectic world.
A shot RINGS out, and the man falls to the ground. Above him, painted on the wall, is a large poster of Marshal Petain, which reads: "Je tiens mes promesses, meme celles des autres."
The policeman frantically searches the body, but only finds Free French literature.
CUT TO:
EXT. PALAIS DE JUSTICE - DAY
We see an inscription carved in a marble block along the roofline of the building: "Liberte, Egalite, Fraternite"
We see the the facade, French in architecture, then the high-vaulted entrance which is inscribed "Palais de Justice".
At the entrance the arrested suspects are led in by the police.
CUT TO:
EXT. SIDEWALK CAFE - DAY
A middle-aged ENGLISH COUPLE sit at a table just off the square, and observe the commotion across the way in front of the Palais de Justice.
The police van pulls up. The rear doors are opened and people stream out.
A EUROPEAN man, sitting at a table nearby, watches the English couple more closely than the scene on the street.
ENGLISHWOMAN
What on earth's going on there?
ENGLISHMAN
I don't know, my dear.
The European walks over to the couple.
EUROPEAN
Pardon, pardon, Monsieur, pardon Madame, have you not heard?
ENGLISHMAN
We hear very little, and we understand even less.
EUROPEAN
Two German couriers were found murdered in the desert -- the unoccupied desert. This is the customary roundup of refugees, liberals, and uh, of course, a beautiful young girl for Monsieur Renault, the Prefect of Police.
CUT TO:
EXT. PALAIS DE JUSTICE - DAY
Suspects are herded out of the van, and into the Palais de Justice.
CUT TO:
EXT. SIDEWALK CAFE - DAY
EUROPEAN
Unfortunately, along with these unhappy refugees the scum of Europe has gravitated to Casablanca. Some of them have been waiting years for a visa.
He puts his left arm compassionately around the Englishman, and reaches behind the man with his right hand.
EUROPEAN
I beg of you, Monsieur, watch yourself. Be on guard. This place is full of vultures, vultures everywhere, everywhere.
The Englishman seems to be taken aback by this sudden display of concern.
ENGLISHMAN
Ha, ha, thank you, thank you very much.
EUROPEAN
Not at all. Au revoir, Monsieur. Au revoir, Madame.
He leaves. The Englishman, still a trifle disconcerted by
the European's action, watches him as he leaves.
ENGLISHMAN
Au revoir. Amusing little fellow. Waiter!
As he pats both his breast and pants pockets he realizes there is something missing.
ENGLISHMAN
Oh. How silly of me.
ENGLISHWOMAN
What, dear?
ENGLISHMAN
I've left my wallet in the hotel.
ENGLISHWOMAN
Oh.
Suddenly the Englishman looks off in the direction of the departed European, the clouds of suspicion gathering.
Interrupting overhead is the DRONE of a low flying airplane.
They look up.
CUT TO:
EXT. OVERHEAD SHOT - DAY
An airplane cuts its motor for landing.
CUT TO:
EXT. PALAIS DE JUSTICE - DAY
Refugees wait in line outside the Palais de Justice. Their upturned gaze follows the flight of the plane. In their faces is revealed one hope they all have in common, and the plane is the symbol of that hope.
Jan and Annina look up at the plane.
ANNINA
wistfully
Perhaps tomorrow we'll be on that plane.
CUT TO:
EXT. OVERHEAD SHOT - DAY
The plane SWOOPS down past a sign atop a building at the edge of the airport.
The sign reads "Rick's Cafe Americain."
CUT TO:
EXT. AIRFIELD - DAY
As the plane lands a swastika on its tail is clearly visible. It taxis to a stop as a group of officers march into formation in front of it. Behind them stand a detail of native soldiers keeping guard.
In the group is CAPTAIN LOUIS RENAULT, a French officer appointed by Vichy as Prefect of Police in Casablanca. He is a handsome, middle-aged Frenchman, debonair and gay, but withal a shrewd and alert official.
With him are HERR HEINZE, the German consul, CAPTAIN TONELLI, an Italian officer, and LIEUTENANT CASSELLE, Renault's aide.
When the plane door opens, the first passenger to step out is a tall, middle-aged, pale German with a smile that seems more the result of a frozen face muscle than a cheerful disposition. On any occasion when MAJOR STRASSER is crossed, his expression hardens into iron.
Herr Heinze steps up to him with upraised arm.
HEINZE
Heil Hitler.
STRASSER
Heil Hitler.
They shake hands.
HEINZE
It is very good to see you again, Major Strasser.
STRASSER
Thank you. Thank you.
Heinze introduces Strasser to Renault.
HEINZE
May I present Captain Renault, Police Prefect of Casablanca. Major Strasser.
Renault salutes.
RENAULT
Unoccupied France welcomes you to Casablanca.
STRASSER
in perfect English, smiling
Thank you, Captain. It's very good to be here.
RENAULT
Major Strasser, my aide, Lieutenant Casselle.
As they acknowledge each other, Captain Tonelli barges in front of Casselle and salutes Strasser.
TONELLI
Captain Tonelli, the Italian service, at your command, Major.
STRASSER
That is kind of you.
But Tonelli gets no further than that as Strasser turns again to Renault. They walk away from the plane, Heinze following, with Casselle and Tonelli bringing up the rear, engaged in a heated exchange of words.
RENAULT
You may find the climate of Casablanca a trifle warm, Major.
STRASSER
Oh, we Germans must get used to all climates, from Russia to the Sahara. But perhaps you were not referring to the weather.
RENAULT
sidesteps the implication with a smile
What else, my dear Major?
STRASSER
casually
By the way, the murder of the couriers, what has been done?
RENAULT
Realizing the importance of the case, my men are rounding up twice the usual number of suspects.
HEINZE
We already know who the murderer is.
STRASSER
Good. Is he in custody?
RENAULT
Oh, there is no hurry. Tonight he'll be at Rick's. Everybody comes to Rick's.
STRASSER
I have already heard about this cafe, and also about Mr. Rick himself.
DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. RICK'S CAFE - NIGHT
The neon sign above the door is brightly lit. Customers arrive and go in through the front door. From inside we hear sounds of MUSIC and LAUGHTER. The song is "It Had to Be You."
Again we isolate on the neon sign.
INSERT SIGN: "Rick's Cafe Americain".
We follow a group of customers inside.
INT. RICK'S CAFE - MAIN ROOM - NIGHT
Rick's is an expensive and chic nightclub which definitely possesses an air of sophistication and intrigue.
SAM, a middle-aged Negro, sits on a stool before a small, salmon-colored piano on wheels, playing and singing while accompanied by a small orchestra.
All about him there is the HUM of voices, CHATTER and LAUGHTER.
The occupants of the room are varied. There are Europeans in their dinner jackets, their women beautifully begowned and bejeweled. There are Moroccans in silk robes. Turks wearing fezzes. Levantines. Naval officers. Members of the Foreign Legion, distinguished by their kepis.
Two men sit at a table.
MAN
Waiting, waiting, waiting. I'll never get out of here. I'll die in Casablanca.
His companion seems uninterested in his dilemma. Sympathy is evidently in short supply in Casablanca.
At another table a very well-dressed WOMAN talks to a MOOR. She has a bracelet on her wrist. No other jewelry.
WOMAN
But can't you make it just a little more? Please.
MOOR
I'm sorry, Madame, but diamonds are a drug on the market. Everybody sells diamonds. There are diamonds everywhere. Two thousand, four hundred.
WOMAN
All right.
On to another table where two CONSPIRATORS talk.
CONSPIRATOR
The trucks are waiting, the men are waiting. Everything is --
He stops abruptly as two German officers walk by.
A REFUGEE and another MAN converse at another table.
MAN
It's the fishing smack Santiago. It leaves at one tomorrow night, here from the end of La Medina. Third boat.
REFUGEE
Thank you, oh, thank you.
MAN
And bring fifteen thousand francs in cash. Remember, in cash.
On the way to the bar we pass several tables and hear a Babel of foreign tongues. Here and there we catch a scattered phrase or sentence in English.
SACHA, a friendly young Russian bartender, hands a drink to a customer with the Russian equivalent of "Bottoms Up." The customer answers with "Cheerio."
CARL, the waiter, is a fat, jovial German refugee with spectacles. He walks, tray in hand, to a private door, over which ABDUL, a large, burly man, stands guard.
CARL
Open up, Abdul.
ABDUL
respectfully
Yes, Herr Professor.
Abdul opens the door and Carl goes into the gambling room.
INT. RICK'S CAFE - GAMBLING ROOM - NIGHT
Their is much activity at the various tables. At one table TWO WOMEN and a MAN play cards. They glance at another table. One of them calls to Carl.
FIRST WOMAN
Uh, waiter.
CARL
Yes, Madame?
FIRST WOMAN
Will you ask Rick if he'll have a drink with us?
CARL
Madame, he never drinks with customers. Never. I have never seen him.
SECOND WOMAN
disappointedly
What makes saloon-keepers so snobbish?
MAN
to Carl
Perhaps if you told him I ran the second largest banking house in Amsterdam.
CARL
The second largest? That wouldn't impress Rick. The leading banker in Amsterdam is now the pastry chef in our kitchen.
MAN
We have something to look forward to.
CARL
And his father is the bellboy.
Carl laughs.
The overseer walks up to a table with a paper in his hand.
Then we see a drink and a man's hand, but nothing more. The overseer places a check on the table. The hand picks up the check and writes on it, in pencil, "Okay-Rick."
The overseer takes the check.
We now see RICK, sitting at a table alone playing solitaire chess. Rick is an American of indeterminate age. There is no expression on his face, complete deadpan.
There is a commotion at the door as people attempt to come into the gambling room. He nods approval to Abdul.
Then a GERMAN appears in the doorway. Abdul looks to Rick who glances back toward the open door and nods "no".
Abdul starts to close the door on the man.
ABDUL
I'm sorry sir, this is a private room.
GERMAN
Of all the nerve! Who do you think -- I know there's gambling in there! There's no secret. You dare not keep me out of here!
The man tries to push his way through the door as Rick walks up.
RICK
coldly
Yes? What's the trouble?
ABDUL
This gentleman --
The German interrupts and waves his card.
GERMAN
I've been in every gambling room between Honolulu and Berlin and if you think I'm going to be kept out of a saloon like this, you're very much mistaken.
At this moment UGARTE, a small, thin man with a nervous air, tries to squeeze through the doorway blocked by the German. If he were an American, Ugarte would look like a tout.
He gets through and passes Rick.
UGARTE
Uh, excuse me, please. Hello, Rick.
RICK
softly
Hello Ugarte.
Rick looks at the German calmly, takes the card out of his hand, and tears it up.
RICK
Your cash is good at the bar.
GERMAN
What! Do you know who I am?
RICK
I do. You're lucky the bar's open to you.
GERMAN
This is outrageous. I shall report it to the Angriff!
The German storms off, tossing the pieces of his card into the air behind him.
Rick meets Ugarte on his way back to his table.
UGARTE
fawning
Huh. You know, Rick, watching you just now with the Deutsches Bank, one would think you'd been doing this all your life.
RICK
stiffening
Well, what makes you think I haven't?
UGARTE
vaguely
Oh, nothing. But when you first came to Casablanca, I thought --
RICK
coldly
-- You thought what?
Fearing to offend Rick, Ugarte laughs.
UGARTE
What right do I have to think?
Ugarte pulls out a chair at Rick's table.
UGARTE
May I? Too bad about those two German couriers, wasn't it?
RICK
indifferently
They got a lucky break. Yesterday they were just two German clerks. Today they're the 'Honored Dead'.
UGARTE
You are a very cynical person, Rick, if you'll forgive me for saying so.
Ugarte sits down.
RICK
shortly
I forgive you.
A waiter comes up to the table with a tray of drinks. He places one before Ugarte.
UGARTE
Thank you.
to Rick
Will you have a drink with me please?
RICK
No.
UGARTE
I forgot. You never drink with --
to waiter
I'll have another, please.
to Rick, sadly
You despise me, don't you?
RICK
indifferently
If I gave you any thought, I probably would.
UGARTE
But why? Oh, you object to the kind of business I do, huh? But think of all those poor refugees who must rot in this place if I didn't help them. That's not so bad. Through ways of my own I provide them with exit visas.
RICK
For a price, Ugarte, for a price.
UGARTE
But think of all the poor devils who cannot meet Renault's price. I get it for them for half. Is that so parasitic?
RICK
I don't mind a parasite. I object to a cut-rate one.
UGARTE
Well, Rick, after tonight I'll be through with the whole business, and I am leaving finally this Casablanca.
RICK
Who did you bribe for your visa? Renault or yourself?
UGARTE
ironically
Myself. I found myself much more reasonable.
He takes an envelope from his pocket and lays it on the table.
UGARTE
Look, Rick, do you know what this is? Something that even you have never seen. Letters of transit signed by General de Gaulle. Cannot be rescinded, not even questioned.
Rick appears ready to take them form Ugarte.
UGARTE
One moment. Tonight I'll be selling those for more money than even I have ever dreamed of, and then, addio Casablanca! You know, Rick, I have many friends in Casablanca, but somehow, just because you despise me you're the only one I trust. Will you keep these for me? Please.
RICK
For how long?
UGARTE
Perhaps an hour, perhaps a little longer.
RICK
I don't want them here overnight.
UGARTE
Don't be afraid of that. Please keep them for me. Thank you. I knew I could trust you.
Rick takes them. Ugarte leaves the table just as the waiter comes up.
UGARTE
Oh, waiter. I'll be expecting some people. If anybody asks for me, I'll be right here.
WAITER
Yes, Monsieur.
The waiter leaves. Ugarte turns to Rick.
UGARTE
Rick, I hope you are more impressed with me now, huh? If you'll forgive me, I'll share my good luck with your roulette wheel.
He starts across the floor.
RICK
Just a moment.
Ugarte stops as Rick comes up to him.
RICK
Yeah, I heard a rumor that those German couriers were carrying letters of transit.
Ugarte hesitates for a moment.
UGARTE
Huh? I heard that rumor, too. Poor devils.
Rick looks at Ugarte steadily.
RICK
slowly
Yes, you're right, Ugarte. I am a little more impressed with you.
Rick leaves the gambling room and goes into the main room.
CUT TO:
INT. RICK'S CAFE - MAIN ROOM - NIGHT
Rick makes his way over to Sam, who plays and sings the "Knock Wood" number, accompanied by the orchestra. The cafe is in semi-darkness. The spotlight is on Sam, and every time the orchestra comes in on the "Knock Wood" business, the spotlight swings over to the orchestra.
During one of the periods when the spotlight is on the orchestra, Rick slips the letters of transit into the piano.
FERRARI, owner of the Blue Parrot, a competing night spot, comes into the cafe, sits down, and watches Sam.
Then he sees Rick and they smile at each other. At the end of the number Ferrari goes to the bar to speak to Rick.
FERRARI
Hello, Rick.
RICK
Hello, Ferrari. How's business at the Blue Parrot?
FERRARI
Fine, but I would like to buy your cafe.
RICK
It's not for sale.
FERRARI
You haven't heard my offer.
RICK
It's not for sale at any price.
FERRARI
What do you want for Sam?
RICK
I don't buy or sell human beings.
FERRARI
That's too bad. That's Casablanca's leading commodity. In refugees alone we could make a fortune if you would work with me through the black market.
RICK
Suppose you run your business and let me run mine.
FERRARI
Suppose we ask Sam. Maybe he'd like to make a change.
RICK
Suppose we do.
FERRARI
My dear Rick, when will you realize that in this world today isolationism is no longer a practical policy?
Rick and Ferrari walk over to the piano.
RICK
Sam, Ferrari wants you to work for him at the Blue Parrot.
SAM
I like it fine here.
RICK
He'll double what I pay you.
SAM
Yeah, but I ain't got time to spend the money I make here.
RICK
Sorry.
Apparently satisfied, Ferrari walks away.
Back at the bar, YVONNE, an attractive young French woman, sits on a stool drinking brandy.
Sacha, who looks at her with lovesick eyes, fills her tumbler.
SACHA
The boss's private stock. Because, Yvonne, I loff you.
YVONNE
morosely
Oh, shut up.
SACHA
fondly
All right, all right. For you, Yvonne, I shot opp, because, Yvonne, I loff you. Uh oh.
Rick saunters over and leans on the bar, next to Yvonne.
He pays no attention to her. She looks at him bitterly, without saying a word.
SACHA
Oh, Monsieur Rick, Monsieur Rick. Some Germans, boom, boom, boom, boom, gave this check. Is it all right?
Rick looks the check over and tears it up. Yvonne has never taken her eyes off Rick.
YVONNE
Where were you last night?
RICK
That's so long ago, I don't remember.
YVONNE
Will I see you tonight?
RICK
matter-of-factly
I never make plans that far ahead.
Yvonne turns, looks at Sacha, and extends her glass to him.
YVONNE
Give me another.
RICK
Sacha, she's had enough.
YVONNE
Don't listen to him, Sacha. Fill it up.
SACHA
Yvonne, I loff you, but he pays me.
Yvonne wheels on Rick with drunken fury.
YVONNE
Rick, I'm sick and tired of having you --
RICK
-- Sacha, call a cab.
SACHA
Yes, boss.
Rick takes Yvonne by the arm.
RICK
Come on, we're going to get your coat.
YVONNE
Take your hands off me!
He pulls her along toward the door.
RICK
No. You're going home. You've had a little too much to drink.
CUT TO:
EXT. RICK'S CAFE - NIGHT
Sacha stands at the curb on the street in front of Rick's and signals for a cab.
SACHA
Taxi!
Soon one pulls up.
Rick and Yvonne come out of the cafe. He puts a coat over her shoulders and she objects violently.
YVONNE
Who do you think you are, pushing me around? What a fool I was to fall for a man like you.
Rick and Yvonne approach the waiting cab.
RICK
to Sacha
You'd better go with her, Sacha, to be sure she gets home.
SACHA
Yes, boss.
RICK
And come right back.
SACHA
his face falling
Yes, boss.
Rick stands and looks up at the revolving beacon light from the airport. It intermittently sheds its light on Rick's face.
Renault sits at a table on the cafe terrace, watching this evening's performance.
RENAULT
Hello, Rick.
Rick walks over to him.
RICK
Hello, Louis.
RENAULT
How extravagant you are, throwing away women like that. Someday they may be scarce.
Rick sits down at the table.
RENAULT
amused
You know, I think now I shall pay a call on Yvonne, maybe get her on the rebound, eh?
RICK
When it comes to women, you're a true democrat.
As they talk, Captain Tonelli and Lieutenant Casselle walk by toward the entrance of the cafe. Casselle talks non-stop and Tonelli tries. They both stop, salute Renault, and walk into the cafe.
RENAULT
If he gets a word in it'll be a major Italian victory.
Rick laughs.
Rick and Renault look up when they hear the BUZZ of a plane taking off from the adjacent airfield. The plane flies directly over their heads.
RENAULT
The plane to Lisbon.
pause
You would like to be on it?
RICK
curtly
Why? What's in Lisbon?
RENAULT
The clipper to America.
Rick doesn't answer. His look isn't a happy one.
RENAULT
I have often speculated on why you don't return to America. Did you abscond with the church funds? Did you run off with a senator's wife? I like to think you killed a man. It's the romantic in me.
Rick still looks in the direction of the airport.
RICK
It was a combination of all three.
RENAULT
And what in heaven's name brought you to Casablanca?
RICK
My health. I came to Casablanca for the waters.
RENAULT
Waters? What waters? We're in the desert.
RICK
I was misinformed.
RENAULT
Huh!
EMIL, the croupier, comes out of the cafe and walks over to Rick.
EMIL
Excuse me, Monsieur Rick, but a gentleman inside has won twenty thousand francs. The cashier would like some money.
RICK
Well, I'll get it from the safe.
EMIL
I am so upset, Monsieur Rick. You know I can't understand --
RICK
-- Forget it, Emil. Mistakes like that happen all the time.
EMIL
I'm awfully sorry.
The three men enter the cafe.
CUT TO:
INT. RICK'S CAFE - MAIN ROOM - NIGHT
They pass Sam at the piano. He's playing "Baby Face". Rick pats Sam on the shoulder.
RENAULT
Rick, there's going to be some excitement here tonight. We are going to make an arrest in your cafe.
RICK
somewhat annoyed
What, again?
RENAULT
This is no ordinary arrest. A murderer, no less.
Rick's eyes react. Involuntarily, they glance toward the gambling room.
Renault catches the look.
RENAULT
If you are thinking of warning him, don't put yourself out. He cannot possibly escape.
RICK
I stick my neck out for nobody.
RENAULT
A wise foreign policy.
They start upstairs to Rick's office, passing Casselle who is still haranguing Tonelli.
RENAULT
You know, Rick, we could have made this arrest earlier in the evening at the Blue Parrot, but out of my high regard for you we are staging it here. It will amuse your customers.
RICK
Our entertainment is enough.
They go inside the office.
INT. RICK'S CAFE - OFFICE - NIGHT
Rick opens up the safe in a small, dark room just off the office. Only Rick's shadow can be seen getting the money out.
RENAULT
Rick, we are to have an important guest tonight, Major Strasser of the Third Reich, no less. We want him to be here when we make the arrest. A little demonstration of the efficiency of my administration.
Rick moves out of the shadows and into view.
RICK
I see. And what's Strasser doing here? He certainly didn't come all the way to Casablanca to witness a demonstration of your efficiency.
RENAULT
Perhaps not.
He gives the money to Emil.
RICK
Here you are.
EMIL
It shall not happen again, Monsieur.
RICK
That's all right.
Emil departs.
RICK
Louis, you've got something on your mind. Why don't you spill it?
Rick closes the door to the office, then goes over to close the safe.
RENAULT
How observant you are. As a matter of fact, I wanted to give you a word of advice.
RICK
Yeah? Have a brandy?
RENAULT
Thank you. Rick, there are many exit visas sold in this cafe, but we know that you have never sold one. That is the reason we permit you to remain open.
RICK
I thought it was because we let you win at roulette.
RENAULT
That is another reason. There is a man who's arrived in Casablanca on his way to America. He will offer a fortune to anyone who will furnish him with an exit visa.
RICK
Yeah? What's his name?
RENAULT
Victor Laszlo.
RICK
Victor Laszlo?
Renault watches Rick's reaction.
RENAULT
Rick, that is the first time I have ever seen you so impressed.
RICK
Well, he's succeeded in impressing half the world.
RENAULT
It is my duty to see that he doesn't impress the other half. Rick, Laszlo must never reach America. He stays in Casablanca.
RICK
It'll be interesting to see how he manages.
RENAULT
Manages what?
RICK
His escape.
RENAULT
Oh, but I just told you. --
RICK
-- Stop it. He escaped from a concentration camp and the Nazis have been chasing him all over Europe.
RENAULT
This is the end of the chase.
RICK
Twenty thousand francs says it isn't.
They sit down to discuss the matter in earnest.
RENAULT
Is that a serious offer?
RICK
I just paid out twenty. I'd like to get it back.
RENAULT
Make it ten. I am only a poor corrupt official.
RICK
Okay.
RENAULT
Done. No matter how clever he is, he still needs an exit visa, or I should say, two.
RICK
Why two?
RENAULT
He is traveling with a lady.
RICK
He'll take one.
RENAULT
I think not. I have seen the lady. And if he did not leave her in Marseilles, or in Oran, he certainly won't leave her in Casablanca.
RICK
Maybe he's not quite as romantic as you are.
RENAULT
It doesn't matter. There is no exit visa for him.
RICK
Louis, whatever gave you the impression that I might be interested in helping Laszlo escape?
RENAULT
Because, my dear Ricky, I suspect that under that cynical shell you're at heart a sentimentalist.
Rick makes a face.
RENAULT
Oh, laugh if you will, but I happen to be familiar with your record. Let me point out just two items. In 1935 you ran guns to Ethiopia. In 1936, you fought in Spain on the Loyalist side.
RICK
And got well paid for it on both occasions.
RENAULT
The winning side would have paid you much better.
RICK
Maybe. Well, it seems you are determined to keep Laszlo here.
RENAULT
I have my orders.
RICK
Oh, I see. Gestapo spank.
Renault stands up.
RENAULT
My dear Ricky, you overestimate the influence of the Gestapo. I don't interfere with them and they don't interfere with me. In Casablanca I am master of my fate. I am captain of my --
He stops short as his AIDE enters.
AIDE
-- Major Strasser is here, sir.
Renault starts to leave.
RICK
Yeah, you were saying?
RENAULT
hurriedly
Excuse me.
He hurries away. Rick smiles cynically.
CUT TO:
INT. RICK'S CAFE - MAIN ROOM - NIGHT
Renault walks up to Carl.
RENAULT
Carl, see that Major Strasser gets a good table, one close to the ladies.
CARL
I have already given him the best, knowing he is German and would take it anyway.
Renault walks over to one of his officers.
RENAULT
Take him quietly. Two guards at every door.
OFFICER
Yes, sir. Everything is ready, sir.
The officer salutes and goes off to speak to the guards.
Renault walks over to Strasser's table as Rick comes down the stairs.
RENAULT
Good evening, gentlemen.
STRASSER
Good evening, Captain.
HEINZE
Won't you join us?
Renault sits down.
RENAULT
Thank you. It is a pleasure to have you here, Major.
STRASSER
to the waiter
Champagne and a tin of caviar.
RENAULT
May I recommend Veuve Cliquot '26, a good French wine.
STRASSER
Thank you.
WAITER
Very well, sir.
STRASSER
A very interesting club.
RENAULT
Especially so tonight, Major. In a few minutes you will see the arrest of the man who murdered your couriers.
STRASSER
I expected no less, Captain.
CUT TO:
INT. RICK'S CAFE - GAMBLING ROOM - NIGHT
Ugarte stands at the roulette table. Two gendarmes approach him from behind.
GENDARME
Monsieur Ugarte?
Ugarte looks around.
UGARTE
Oh. Yes?
GENDARME
Will you please come with us.
UGARTE
Certainly. May I first please cash my chips?
The officer nods. They follow Ugarte to the cashier's window. Ugarte puts his chips through the window to the CASHIER.
UGARTE
Pretty lucky, huh? Two thousand, please.
Two more guards station themselves at the door in case there is trouble.
CASHIER
Two thousand.
UGARTE
Thank you.
Ugarte starts to walk out, followed by the gendarmes. When he reaches the doorway he suddenly rushes through and slams the door behind himself.
INT. RICK'S CAFE - MAIN ROOM - NIGHT
By the time the gendarmes manage to get the door open again, Ugarte has pulled a gun.
He FIRES at the doorway. The SHOTS bring on pandemonium in the cafe.
As Ugarte runs through the hallway he sees Rick, appearing from the opposite direction, and grabs him.
UGARTE
Rick! Rick, help me!
RICK
Don't be a fool. You can't get away.
UGARTE
Rick, hide me. Do something! You must help me, Rick. Do something!
Guards and gendarmes rush in and grab Ugarte. Rick stands impassively as they drag Ugarte off.
UGARTE
Rick! Rick!
We move to Strasser's table, who has witnessed the event.
STRASSER
Excellent, Captain.
Back to Rick, still standing where he was, as a CUSTOMER walks by.
CUSTOMER
When they come to get me, Rick, I hope you'll be more of a help.
RICK
I stick my neck out for nobody.
Rick comes out to the middle of the floor. An air of tense expectancy pervades the room. A few customers are on the point of leaving. Rick speaks in a very calm voice.
RICK
I'm sorry there was a disturbance, folks, but it's all over now. Everything's all right. Just sit down and have a good time. Enjoy yourself.
Rick glances toward Sam.
RICK
All right, Sam.
Sam nods and begins to play.
Renault, Strasser, and Heinze sit calmly at their table after witnessing the arrest.
Rick walks by.
RENAULT
calling to Rick
Oh, Rick?
Rick stops and comes over to their table.
RENAULT
Rick, this is Major Heinrich Strasser of the Third Reich.
STRASSER
How do you do, Mr. Rick?
RICK
Oh, how do you do?
RENAULT
And you already know Herr Heinze of the Third Reich.
Rick nods to Strasser and Heinze.
STRASSER
Please join us, Mr. Rick.
Rick sits down with them.
RENAULT
We are very honored tonight, Rick. Major Strasser is one of the reasons the Third Reich enjoys the reputation it has today.
STRASSER
You repeat "Third Reich" as though you expected there to be others.
RENAULT
Well, personally, Major, I will take what comes.
STRASSER
to Rick
Do you mind if I ask you a few questions? Unofficially, of course.
RICK
Make it official, if you like.
STRASSER
What is your nationality?
RICK
pokerfaced
I'm a drunkard.
RENAULT
That makes Rick a citizen of the world.
RICK
I was born in New York City if that'll help you any.
STRASSER
I understand you came here from Paris at the time of the occupation.
RICK
There seems to be no secret about that.
STRASSER
Are you one of those people who cannot imagine the Germans in their beloved Paris?
RICK
It's not particularly my beloved Paris.
HEINZE
Can you imagine us in London?
RICK
When you get there, ask me.
RENAULT
Ho, diplomatist!
STRASSER
How about New York?
RICK
Well, there are certain sections of New York, Major, that I wouldn't advise you to try to invade.
STRASSER
Aha. Who do you think will win the war?
RICK
I haven't the slightest idea.
RENAULT
Rick is completely neutral about everything. And that takes in the field of women, too.
STRASSER
You weren't always so carefully neutral. We have a complete dossier on you.
Strasser takes a little black book from his pocket and turns to a certain page.
STRASSER
"Richard Blaine, American. Age, thirty-seven. Cannot return to his country."
Strasser looks up from the book
STRASSER
The reason is a little vague. We also know what you did in Paris, Mr. Blaine, and also we know why you left Paris.
Rick reaches over and takes the book from Strasser's hand.
STRASSER
Don't worry. We are not going to broadcast it.
Rick looks up from the book.
RICK
Are my eyes really brown?
STRASSER
You will forgive my curiosity, Mr. Blaine. The point is, an enemy of the Reich has come to Casablanca and we are checking up on anybody who can be of any help to us.
RICK
glances toward Renault
My interest in whether Victor Laszlo stays or goes is purely a sporting one.
STRASSER
In this case, you have no sympathy for the fox, huh?
RICK
Not particularly. I understand the point of view of the hound, too.
STRASSER
Victor Laszlo published the foulest lies in the Prague newspapers until the very day we marched in, and even after that he continued to print scandal sheets in a cellar.
RENAULT
Of course, one must admit he has great courage.
STRASSER
I admit he is very clever. Three times he slipped through our fingers. In Paris he continued his activities. We intend not to let it happen again.
Rick gets up.
RICK
You'll excuse me, gentlemen. Your business is politics. Mine is running a saloon.
STRASSER
Good evening, Mr. Blaine.
Rick walks away toward the gambling room.
RENAULT
You see, Major, you have nothing to worry about Rick.
STRASSER
Perhaps.
A couple comes in the front door. They are VICTOR LASZLO, the Czech resistance leader, and a very pretty young woman wearing a simple white gown, MISS ILSA LUND. She is so beautiful, in fact, that people turn to stare.
The HEADWAITER comes up to them.
HEADWAITER
Yes, Monsieur?
LASZLO
I reserved a table. Victor Laszlo.
HEADWAITER
Yes, Monsieur Laszlo. Right this way.
As the headwaiter takes them to a table they pass by the piano, and the woman looks at Sam.
Sam, with a conscious effort, keeps his eyes on the keyboard as they go past. He appears to know this woman. After she has gone by Sam steals a look in her direction.
BERGER, a slight, middle-aged man, observes the couple from a distance.
The headwaiter seats Ilsa. Laszlo takes the chair opposite and surveys the room.
Strasser and Renault look up at them from their table.
LASZLO
Two cointreaux, please.
WAITER
Yes, Monsieur.
LASZLO
to Ilsa
I saw no one of Ugarte's description.
ILSA
Victor, I, I feel somehow we shouldn't stay here.
LASZLO
If we would walk out so soon, it would only call attention to us. Perhaps Ugarte's in some other part of the cafe.
Berger walks up to their table.
BERGER
Excuse me, but you look like a couple who are on their way to America.
LASZLO
Well?
Berger takes a ring from his finger.
BERGER
You will find a market there for this ring. I am forced to sell it at a great sacrifice.
LASZLO
Thank you, but I hardly think --
BERGER
-- Then perhaps for the lady. The ring is quite unique.
He holds it down for their view. Carefully lifting up the stone, he reveals--
INSERT - a gold plate in the setting underneath, an impression of the Lorraine Cross of General de Gaulle.
LASZLO
Oh, yes, I'm very interested.
Berger sits down with them.
BERGER
Good.
LASZLO
lower voice
What is your name?
BERGER
Berger, Norwegian, and at your service, sir.
Renault approaches the table from behind Laszlo. Ilsa tries to warn him.
ILSA
Victor--
Laszlo understands.
LASZLO
in a low voice
I'll meet you in a few minutes at the bar.
in a louder voice
I do not think we want to buy the ring. But thank you for showing it to us.
Berger, taking the cue, sighs and puts the ring away.
BERGER
Such a bargain. But that is your decision?
LASZLO
I'm sorry. It is.
Berger gets up and leaves as Renault moves to the table.
RENAULT
Monsieur Laszlo, is it not?
LASZLO
Yes.
RENAULT
I am Captain Renault, Prefect of Police.
LASZLO
Yes. What is it you want?
RENAULT
amiably
Merely to welcome you to Casablanca and wish you a pleasant stay. It is not often we have so distinguished a visitor.
LASZLO
Thank you. I hope you'll forgive me, Captain, but the present French administration has not always been so cordial. May I present Miss Ilsa Lund?
RENAULT
I was informed you were the most beautiful woman ever to visit Casablanca. That was a gross understatement.
Ilsa's manner is friendly and reserved, her voice low and soft.
ILSA
You are very kind.
LASZLO
Won't you join us?
He sits down.
RENAULT
If you will permit me.
calls to the waiter
Oh, Emil. Please, a bottle of your best champagne, and put it on my bill.
EMIL
Very well, sir.
LASZLO
No, Captain, please.
RENAULT
No. Please, Monsieur, it is a little game we play. They put it on the bill, I tear the bill up. It is very convenient.
Ilsa glances off in Sam's direction.
ILSA
Captain, the boy who is playing the piano, somewhere I have seen him.
RENAULT
Sam?
ILSA
Yes.
RENAULT
He came from Paris with Rick.
ILSA
Rick? Who's he?
RENAULT
smiling
Mademoiselle, you are in Rick's and Rick is --
ILSA
-- Is what?
RENAULT
Well, Mademoiselle, he's the kind of a man that, well, if I were a woman and I--
taps his chest
were not around, I should be in love with Rick. But what a fool I am talking to a beautiful woman about another man.
Renault jumps to his feet as Strasser enters.
RENAULT
Excuse me. Ah, Major. Mademoiselle Lund, Monsieur Laszlo, may I present Major Heinrich Strasser.
Strasser bows and smiles pleasantly.
STRASSER
How do you do. This is a pleasure I have long looked forward to.
There is not the slightest recognition from either Ilsa or Laszlo.
Strasser waits to be asked to seat himself.
LASZLO
I'm sure you'll excuse me if I am not gracious, but you see, Major Strasser, I'm a Czechoslovakian.
STRASSER
You were a Czechoslovakian. Now you are a subject of the German Reich!
Laszlo stands.
LASZLO
I've never accepted that privilege, and I'm now on French soil.
STRASSER
I should like to discuss some matters arising from your presence on French soil.
LASZLO
This is hardly the time or the place.
STRASSER
hardening
Then we shall state another time and another place. Tomorrow at ten in the Prefect's office, with Mademoiselle.
LASZLO
Captain Renault, I am under your authority. Is it your order that we come to your office?
RENAULT
amiably
Let us say that it is my request. That is a much more pleasant word.
LASZLO
Very well.
Renault and Strasser bow shortly.
RENAULT
Mademoiselle.
STRASSER
Mademoiselle.
Renault and Strasser walk away.
RENAULT
A very clever tactical retreat, Major.
Strasser looks at Renault sharply, but sees only a noncommittal smile on Renault's face.
Laszlo remains standing at the table as Strasser and Renault leave.
LASZLO
This time they really mean to stop me.
ILSA
Victor, I'm afraid for you.
LASZLO
We have been in difficult places before, haven't we?
Ilsa smiles back at him, but her eyes are still troubled.
On the floor, CORINA strums a guitar and begins her number.
Meanwhile, Laszlo looks about with apparent casualness. He sees Strasser and Renault whispering together, then notices Berger at the bar.
LASZLO
I must find out what Berger knows.
ILSA
Be careful.
LASZLO
I will, don't worry.
He rises and goes off.
We see Ilsa's troubled profile.
While Corinna sings, Sam gives a worried glance in Ilsa's direction. Ilsa watches him.
At the bar, Berger sips a drink. Laszlo walks up and casually takes a place at the bar next to Berger.
LASZLO
Mr. Berger, the ring, could I see it again?
BERGER
Yes, Monsieur.
LASZLO
to Sacha
A champagne cocktail, please.
Laszlo takes the ring and looks at it.
BERGER
in a low voice
I recognize you from the news photographs, Monsieur Laszlo.
LASZLO
In a concentration camp, one is apt to lose a little weight.
BERGER
We read five times that you were killed in five different places.
LASZLO
smiles wryly
As you see, it was true every single time. Thank heaven I found you, Berger. I am looking for a man by the name of Ugarte. He is supposed to help me.
Berger shakes his head.
BERGER
Ugarte cannot even help himself, Monsieur. He is under arrest for murder. He was arrested here tonight.
Laszlo absorbs the shock quietly.
LASZLO
I see.
BERGER
with intense devotion
But we who are still free will do all we can. We are organized, Monsieur, underground like everywhere else. Tomorrow night there is a meeting at the Caverne du Bois. If you would come--
He stops when Sacha brings the drink to Laszlo.
Corina finishes her song, and the crowd applauds quite enthusiastically.
Ilsa sits alone at her table.
ILSA
to waiter
Will you ask the piano player to come over here, please?
WAITER
Very well, Mademoiselle.
Renault comes up to the bar near Berger and Laszlo.
RENAULT
How's the jewelry business, Berger?
BERGER
Er, not so good.
to Sacha
May I have my check, please?
RENAULT
Too bad you weren't here earlier, Monsieur Laszlo. We had quite a bit of excitement this evening, didn't we, Berger?
BERGER
Er, yes. Excuse me, gentlemen.
LASZLO
My bill.
RENAULT
No. Two champagne cocktails, please.
SACHA
Yes, sir.
Sam wheels in the piano to Ilsa's table. On his face is that funny fear.
Ilsa herself is not as self-possessed as she tries to appear. There is something behind this, some mystery.
ILSA
Hello, Sam.
SAM
Hello, Miss Ilsa. I never expected to see you again.
He sits down and is ready to play.
ILSA
It's been a long time.
SAM
Yes, ma'am. A lot of water under the bridge.
ILSA
Some of the old songs, Sam.
SAM
Yes, ma'am.
Sam begins to play a number. He is nervous, waiting for anything.
ILSA
Where is Rick?
SAM
evading
I don't know. I ain't seen him all night.
Sam looks very uncomfortable.
ILSA
When will he be back?
SAM
Not tonight no more. He ain't coming. Uh, he went home.
ILSA
Does he always leave so early?
SAM
Oh, he never-- well--
desperately
he's got a girl up at the Blue Parrot. He goes up there all the time.
ILSA
You used to be a much better liar, Sam.
SAM
Leave him alone, Miss Ilsa. You're bad luck to him.
ILSA
Play it once, Sam, for old time's sake.
SAM
I don't know what you mean, Miss Ilsa.
ILSA
Play it, Sam. Play "As Time Goes By."
SAM
Oh I can't remember it, Miss Ilsa. I'm a little rusty on it.
Of course he can. He doesn't want to play it. He seems even more scared now.
ILSA
I'll hum it for you.
Ilsa starts to hum.
Sam begins to play it very softly.
ILSA
Sing it, Sam.
And Sam sings.
SAM
You must remember this, A kiss is just a kiss, A sigh is just a sigh, The fundamental things apply, As time goes by.
The door to the gambling room opens. Rick comes swinging out. He's heard the music and he's livid.
SAM
And when two lovers woo, They both say I love you, On that you can rely, No matter what the future brings, As time goes by.
Rick walks briskly up to the piano.
RICK
Sam, I thought I told you never to play--
As he sees Ilsa he stops short. Sam stops playing.
Two close-ups reveal Ilsa and Rick seeing each other.
Rick appears shocked. For a long moment he just looks at her.
Sam prepares to move the piano away.
Renault and Laszlo approach the table from the bar.
RENAULT
to Ilsa
Well, you were asking about Rick and here he is. Mademoiselle, may I present --
RICK
-- Hello, Ilsa.
ILSA
Hello, Rick.
RENAULT
Oh, you've already met Rick, Mademoiselle?
There's no answer from either.
RENAULT
Well then, perhaps you also ---
ILSA
-- This is Mr. Laszlo.
LASZLO
How do you do?
RICK
How do you do?
LASZLO
One hears a great deal about Rick in Casablanca.
RICK
And about Victor Laszlo everywhere.
LASZLO
Won't you join us for a drink?
RENAULT
laughing
Oh, no, Rick never --
RICK
-- Thanks. I will.
Rick sits down.
RENAULT
Well! A precedent is being broken. Er, Emil!
LASZLO
This is a very interesting cafe. I congratulate you.
RICK
And I congratulate you.
LASZLO
What for?
RICK
Your work.
LASZLO
Thank you. I try.
RICK
We all try. You succeed.
RENAULT
I can't get over you two. She was asking about you earlier, Rick, in a way that made me extremely jealous.
ILSA
to Rick
I wasn't sure you were the same. Let's see, the last time we met --
RICK
-- It was "La Belle Aurore."
ILSA
How nice. You remembered. But of course, that was the day the Germans marched into Paris.
RICK
Not an easy day to forget.
ILSA
No.
RICK
I remember every detail. The Germans wore gray, you wore blue.
ILSA
Yes. I put that dress away. When the Germans march out, I'll wear it again.
RENAULT
Ricky, you're becoming quite human. I suppose we have to thank you for that, Mademoiselle.
LASZLO
Ilsa, I don't wish to be the one to say it, but it's late.
RENAULT
glancing at his wristwatch
So it is. And we have a curfew here in Casablanca. It would never do for the Chief of Police to be found drinking after hours and have to fine himself.
Rick and Ilsa look at each other.
Laszlo signals the waiter
LASZLO
I hope we didn't overstay our welcome.
RICK
Not at all.
WAITER
to Laszlo
Your check, sir.
Rick takes the check.
RICK
to waiter
Oh, it's my party.
RENAULT
Another precedent gone. This has been a very interesting evening. I'll call you a cab. Gasoline rationing, time of night.
Renault leaves.
LASZLO
We'll come again.
RICK
Any time.
ILSA
Say goodnight to Sam for me.
RICK
I will.
ILSA
There's still nobody in the world who can play "As Time Goes By" like Sam.
RICK
He hasn't played it in a long time.
Ilsa smiles.
ILSA
Goodnight.
LASZLO
Goodnight.
RICK
Goodnight.
Rick and Laszlo nod goodnight to each other. Laszlo and Ilsa start to the door as Rick sits down again and stares off in their direction.
