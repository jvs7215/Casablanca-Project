                friendly young Russian bartender, hands a drink to a customer with the Russian
                equivalent of "Bottoms Up." The customer answers with "Cheerio." CARL, the waiter,
                is a fat, jovial German refugee with spectacles. He walks, tray in hand, to a
                private door, over which ABDUL, a large, burly man, stands guard. </diag></sp>

                but nothing more. The overseer places a check on the table. The hand picks up the
                check and writes on it, in pencil, "Okay-Rick." The overseer takes the check. We now
                see RICK, sitting at a table alone playing solitaire chess. Rick is an American of
                indeterminate age. There is no expression on his face, complete deadpan. There is a
                commotion at the door as people attempt to come into the gambling room. He nods
                approval to Abdul. Then a GERMAN appears in the doorway. Abdul looks to Rick who
                glances back toward the open door and nods "no". Abdul starts to close the door on
                the man. </diag></sp>

                squeeze through the doorway blocked by the German. If he were an American, Ugarte
                would look like a tout. He gets through and passes Rick. </diag></sp>

        <sp><speaker who="Rick">RICK</speaker><diag> softly Hello Ugarte. Rick looks at the German calmly,

        <sp><speaker who="Ugarte">UGARTE</speaker><diag> fawning Huh. You know, Rick, watching you just now with
