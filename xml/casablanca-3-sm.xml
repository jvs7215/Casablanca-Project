                "Marseillaise" continues, however. Yvonne jumps up and sings with tears in her eyes.
                Ilsa, overcome with emotion, looks proudly at Laszlo, who sings with passion.
                Finally the whole cafe stands, singing, their faces aglow. The song finishes on a
                high, triumphant note. Yvonne's face is exalted. She deliberately faces the alcove
                where the Germans are watching. She SHOUTS at the top of her lungs.</dir>
