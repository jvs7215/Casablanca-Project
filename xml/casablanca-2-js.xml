                the floor reflects the cafe sign "La Belle Aurore." Rick, at the bar, gets glasses
                and a bottle of champagne. He walks over to Ilsa and Sam at the piano. Sam plays "As
                Time Goes By." Ilsa seems unnerved. There is evidently something on her mind. Rick
                pours the champagne. His manner is wry, but not the bitter wryness we have seen in
