Tbe intense desert sun bolds tbe scene in a torpid tranquility. Act.ivity is unhurried and sounds are muted ... Suddenly the screech of a siren shatters the calm. Veiled women run screaming for shelter. Street vendors, beggars and urch.ins melt into doorways. A police car speeds into the SHOT and pulls up before au old-fashioned Moorish hotel flop-house would be a better word for it. CUT TO: 6 INT. CORRIDOR of this decrepit hotel. Native French police officers run up the steps, crash into the doors of the various rooms, come out --dragging frightened refugees. CUT TO: 7 CLOSE SHOT -DOOR as one police officer flings it open.

CAMERA CONTINUES TO PANDOWN to the entrance. A queue of people of all ages and nationalities overflow from inside the building and down the steps. The CAMERAPANS OVER the line of waiting people ex~ending into the square. We PICK UP a babel of languages with only a few recognizable words such as, "visa", "Monsieur le Prefect", "Portugal", "a hundred francs", etc. Sudden¥ ly the at~ention of the people is a~tracted toward the street. 12 THE S~UARE (FROM THE ANGLEOF THE WAITING LINE) The square is typically French in its landscaping and architecture. This is tbe center of the modern ci~y of Casablanca. The police car is just pulling up to the curb io !root of the Prefecture. A policeman opens the grateddoor at the back of the car and a nondescript assortment of refugees begin to pour out. 13 SIDEWALKCAFE ON ONE SIDE OF THE SQUARE A middle-aged English couple are standing in front of their table for a better view of tbe commotion in front of the Prefecture. A dark-visaged European smoking a cig.arette leans against a lamp post a sbort distance away.He is watching the English couple more closely than the scene on the street. ENGLISHWOMAN What on earth's going on there? DARK EUROPEAN (walking over to tbe couple) Pardon, Madame ¥¥¥ bave you not beard? ENGLISHWOMAN We bear very little --and we understand even less. (CONTI NUED) 13 CONTINUED: .

Bonjour, M'sieur. He walks OUT of the SHOT. The Englishman, still a trifle disconcerted by the European's action, looks after him, mopping hiS brow with his pocket handkerchief. ENGLISHMAN (restoring his pocket handkerchief) Friendly chap, wasn't be? As he pats his breast pocket there is something lacking.

The CAMERASTOPS at the last of the line far out on the street, just as Jan and Annina appear and take their places at the very end. Their eyes also follow the droning plane. ANNlNA Perhaps tomorrow we shall be on the plane.(wistfully) Jan smiles at his wife with superior knowledge. DISSOLVE TO: 19 AIRPORT -THE PLANE is swooping down --past a neon sign on a building on the edge of the airport. The sign reads: "RICKS". 20 GROUP SHOT CAPTAIN LOUIS RENAULT, a French officer appointed by Vichy as Prefect of Police in Casablanca, stands chatting with other officers. He is a handsome, middle-aged Frenchman, debonair and gay, but withal a shrewd and alert official. Around bim are clustered the German Consul, HERR HEINZE, a young Italian officer, CAPTAIN TONELLI, and Renault's aide, LIEUTENANT CASSELLE. Behind them is a detail of Prencb native soldiers. The officers watch the approach.ing plane as it taxis toward them. Tbe German and Italian (CONTINUED) 20 CONTINUED: detach themselves from the group and walk toward the place where the plane will stop. The German walks briskly a step ahead of the Italian, who appears to be making an effort to catch up. 21 THE PLANE -WITH THE SWASTIKA OVER THE DOOR When the door is opened, tbe first passenger to step out is a large German wearing beavy, born-rimmed spectacles. He is bland-faced, with a perpetual smile that seems more tbe result of a frozen face muscle than a cheerful dispo.sition. On acy occasion whee MAJOR STRASSER is crossed, tbe smile melts and the expression hardens into iron. Herr Heinze steps up to him with upraised arm. HEINZE Heil Hitler. STRASSER (with a more relaxed gesture) Heil bi tler. Tbey sha~e hands. HEINZE (in German) It is good to see you again, Major Strasser. STRASSER (in German) Tbank you, thank you. Strasser turns to greet Renault and Casselle, who have come INTO THE SHOT. Herr Heicze makes tbe introduction. HEINZE (in English) May I presect Captain Renault, Police Prefect of Casablanca ¥¥¥ Major Strasser. Tbe two shake hands. (CONTINUED) 21 CONTINUED: RENAULT (ccurteously -but with just a suggestionof mockery underneath bis words) Unoccupied France welcomes Jou to Casablanca. STRASSER (in perfect English .beaming on the Frenchman)Thank you. Captain. It is verygood to be here. TONELLI Captain Tonelli, of the Italian staff, at your service, sir. STRASSER That is kind of you. TONELLI Our staff is anxious to cooperate. RENAULT Major, may I present my aide, Lieutenant Casselle. Casselle does not offer to shake hands. They merely sal.ute and bow. Renault leads Strasser toward the edge of the air field, where their cars await them. Heinze and Casselle follow, with the Italian captain left to bring upthe rear. 22 TRUCKINGSHOT -RENAULTAND STRASSER walking toward the cars. RENAULT (again tbe suggestion of a double-edgedinference)You may find the climate of Casa.blanca a trifle warm, Major. STRASSER Oh. we Germans must get used to all climates -from Russia to the Sahara. (suddenly the smile fades and the eyes harden) But perhaps you were not referring to the weather. (CONTINUED) 10. CON'I'INUED: RENAULT {sidesteps the impli.cation witb a smile) What else, my dear Major? STRASSER (casual again) By the way, the murder of the couriers --what has been done? RENAULT Realizing tbe importance of the case, my men are rounding uptwice the usual number of sus.pects. Again Strasser looks at him sharply. HEINZE captain Renault means that the round-up is a blind. We already kn ow who the murderer is. STRASSER Good. Is he in custody? RENAULT There 1s no hurry. Tonight he will come to Rick's. (indicating the cafe at tbe air.port¥ s edge) Everybody comes to Rick's. Heinze shrugs to i ndi ca te that he can do nothing wi 'th Renault. STRASSER I bave already beard abou't this cafe --and also about M'sieur Rick himself. As tbey arrive at tbe car .DISSOLVE TO: 11. 23 OMITTED. 24 ELECTRIC SIGN -"RICK'S 11 -NIGHT CAMERA PANS DOWN TO: 25 ENTRANCETO RICK'S Rick's car drives up.

They needed him in Prague, but there tbe Gestapo ¥ere waiting for him. Just a two line item in the paper:"Victor Laszlo apprehended. Sent to concentration camp." I was frantic. For months I tried to get work. Then it came. He was dead, shot, trying to escape. I was lonely. I bad noth.ing. Not even hope. Then I met you. RICK Why weren't you bonest with me? Whydid you keep your marriage a secret? ILSA Oh, it wasu't my secret, Richard. Victor wanted it tbat way. Not even our closest friends knew about our marria1e. That was bis way of pro.tecting me. I knew so much about bis work, and if tbe Gestapo found out I was his wife it would be dangerousfor me and for those working witb us. RICK lel~, when did Jou first find out he was alive? ILSA Just before you and I were to leave Paris together. A friend came and told me that Victor was alive. Tbey were hiding him in a frei&ht car on the outskirts of Paris. Be was sick; he needed me. á(sighing) I wanted to tell you, but I didn't¥ dare. 1 knew, I knew Jou wouldn't have left Paris, and the Gestapo would have caught you. So I -.well, well, you know the rest. (CONTINUED) 130. 232 CONTINUED: RICK Huh. But it's still a story without an endinc. (looks at her directly)Wba t about now? ILSA Now?

You'll see he gets out? (Rick nods)Then he'll have his work --all that he's been living for. A pause. RICK All except one. He won't b&ve you. ILSA I can't ficht it any more. I ran ¥away from you once. I can't do it again. I don't know what's right any longer. You'll have to think for both of us, for all of us. RICK All right, I will. Here's looking at you, kid. ILSA (in a wbisper)I wish I didn't love you so mucb. Sbe draws bis face down to bers. Then Rick hears a noise. Putting his glass down, he goes to door. She follows.

I set the point. Wit~ tbe bottle in his hand, Rick starts around toward the froct of the bar, Laszlo's body turning as he presses Rick close lY ¥ LASZLO I wonder if you do. I wonder if you know that you're trying to escape from yourself and thatá you'll never succeed. Rick looks at Laszlo for a moment, then sits down at a table and begins to pour himself another drink. RICK (ironically)You seemá to know all about my"destiny." LASZLO I know a good deal more about you than you suspect. I know, for in.stance, that you are in love with a woman. Rick has lifted his glass to drink. He puts it down, stares at Laszlo, who stands facing him from the bar. LASZLO (smiles just a little)It is perhaps a strange circum.stance that we should be in love with the same woman. Rick straightens up in his chair, watches Laszlo closely. Laszlo walks over to the table. LASZLO I knew there was something between you and Ilsa thv first evening I came in this place. Since no one is to blame, I demand no explana.tions. I ask only one thing. (CONTINUED) 237 CONTINUED: (l) He sits down. Their eyes bold across tbe table. LASZLO . You Will not 11ve me tbe Letters of Transit. All ri&ht.

Well, I am also a human being .¥¥ (looks away for a moment, then quietly)Yes, I love ber that much. At tbis moment there is a sharp knock on tbe front door of the cafe, followed by the entrance of several gendarmes.Rick and Laszlo rise as a French Officer walks into the lighted area, addresses ~aszlo. FRENCHOFFICER Mr. Laszlo? LASZLO Yes. FRENCH OFFICER You will come with us. We have a warrant for your arrest. LASZLO On wbat charge? FRENCH OFFICER Captain Renault will discuss tbat with you later. Laszlo looks at Rick wbo smiles ironically. RICK It seems "destiny" bas taken a band.á In dignified silence, Laszlo crosses to the Police Officer. Together they walk toward the door.

If by any chance you were to help him escape RICK ( cu t 'ti ng 1 n ) What makes you think I'd s~1c~ my neck out for Laszlo? RENAULT Because one: You have bet ten thousand francs that Laszlo will escape.

Why are you still interested in what happens to Laszlo? RICK I'm not. But I am interested in what happens to Ilsa and me. We bave a legal right to go that's true. But people have been held in Casablanca in spite of their legal rights. RENAULT What makes you think we want to hold you. RICK Ilsa is Laszlo's wife. She knows a good deal that Strasser would like to know. Louis, I'll make a deal ¥1th you. Instead of the petty charge you bave against bim you can get something really big, something that would chuck him in a concentratioD camp for years,that would be quite a feather in your cap, wouldn't it? (CONTINUED) 7/14/4'J. 131:S. 238: CONTI!-JUED: (1) RENAULT It most certainly would. Germany ¥¥¥ (corrects himself)Vichy would be grateful. RICK Then release bim and be at myplace a balf bour before tbe plane leaves. I'll arrance for Laszlo to come for the Letters of Transit. That will cive you crim.inal grounds to make tbe arrest. You 1et bim, and we 1et away. To tbe Germans that will only be a minor annoyance. RENAULT (puzzled)There's something I don't under.stand about this business. Miss Lund --she's very beautiful, yes¥.. But you were never interested in any woman. RICK Well, she isn't just any woman. RENAULT l see. How do I know you'll keep your end of the bargain? RICK I'll make the arrancements with Laszlo right now in the visitor's pen. RENAULT Ricky, I'm 1onna miss you.
